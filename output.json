    "title": "Underpriced Stocks In The Small-Value Corner",
    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

    "title": "Billionaire Reid Hoffman Spent $2 Million On Biden’s New Hampshire Write-In Campaign, FEC Records Show",
    "content": "Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman donated $2 million to help fund the campaign urging Democratic primary voters to write President Joe Biden’s name on New Hampshire primary ballots, newly filed Federal Election Commission records show, as Hoffman has poured his resources into a string of anti-Trump efforts in recent years. Reid Hoffman speaks onstage during The AI Optimist Club at WIRED Celebrates 30th Anniversary With  Hoffman donated $2 million to the Granite for America super PAC that led the pro-Biden write-in campaign in New Hampshire, where Biden won the primary last week despite his absence from the ballot following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties over the new primary schedule. Hoffman donated almost 99% of the $2,025,000 the group raised since its inception in November, according to end-of-year   released Wednesday. New Hampshire Democratic Party Vice Chair Martha Fuller Clark, a former state lawmaker, donated the remaining $25,000. The group, founded by New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan, spent $239,826 through the end of December while a similarly named group supporting the effort, Granite State Write-In, spent $31,623 of the $56,559 it raised last year, records show. Hoffman, a longtime Biden supporter, is a prolific donor to efforts designed to boost Democrats and challenge former President Donald Trump—he helped fund writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault suit against the former president, former Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) failed 2022 reelection campaign and has given millions to the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project. Hoffman also donated $250,000 to a super PAC backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s Republican presidential campaign, his political advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn told Forbes previously, and a non-profit Hoffman supports helped fund a super PAC backing former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s now-defunct GOP presidential campaign, according to the  64%. That’s the share of votes Biden won in New Hampshire, beating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who earned 20% of votes, and author Marianne Williamson (4%). Hoffman has reportedly decided to stop giving to Haley’s campaign after her losses to Trump in New Hampshire and Iowa,  , citing a source familiar with his thinking. Hoffman said in December he donated to Haley because his “first priority is to defeat Trump,” noting she “would not be as good for America as Joe Biden, but America would survive her administration.” Hoffman is among a growing number of megadonors re-evaluating their priorities as Trump appears poised to clinch the nomination. Billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of the Citadel hedge fund and a Republican mega donor, also gave $5 million to support Haley’s campaign, but expressed doubts this week in an interview with   about the future of her candidacy. \"Her poise, admirable; her foreign policy experience, tremendous; her ability to unite this country, phenomenal,” Griffin said. “I just don't know, though, that at this moment, that's going to get her where she needs to get to in South Carolina and thereafter.” The Democratic National Committee moved South Carolina ahead of New Hampshire on this year’s primary calendar in part in a bid to galvanize Biden’s base of Black voters in subsequent primary contests. The New Hampshire Democratic Party refused to recognize the move, however, and proceeded to hold its primary in conjunction with the GOP contest last week. Biden, siding with the DNC, opted not to appear on the ballot, and the DNC penalized the state by removing its delegates. Local volunteers with the Biden write-in effort ran a grassroots campaign, largely consisting of ads and mailers, encouraging voters to pen his name on their ballots."

    "content": "French soccer star Kylian Mbappé has reportedly decided to join Real Madrid this summer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, ending months of speculation that the Spanish club could land the 25-year-old superstar. PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018. Real Madrid is the most valuable soccer team in the world,  , worth just over $6 billion."

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has navigated a trying month for his firm. Boeing generated $22 billion of sales during the fourth quarter, easily beating consensus analyst estimates of $21.2 billion compiled by FactSet, while its $0.47 loss per share also beat forecasts of $0.78. But as observed by Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned in a Monday preview note to clients, this quarter was “unusual” and “nothing” in the typically-tracked earnings metrics are likely to be “useful” for Boeing. As such, Boeing declined to provide guidance for 2024 sales as it typically does in its first earnings call of the year. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun explained that “now is not the time” for forward-looking financial statements as the company must “focus…on doing everything possible” to satisfy customers and regulators alike amid controversy over the safety of the company’s commercial planes,   to a memo sent to employees obtained by Bloomberg. Though Boeing was coy about its 2024 outlook, analysts project a strong year for the company. Consensus estimates of a $3.4 billion full-year net profit would make 2024 Boeing’s first profitable year since 2018, while its $89.7 billion in projected revenue would similarly be a six-year best.

    "title": "Why Biden Can’t Easily ‘Shut Down The Border’—As Both He And Trump Have Suggested",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump amped up his campaign Wednesday against border legislation being negotiated in Congress, claiming President Joe Biden has the immediate authority to shut down the border amid a surge in migrant crossings—but closing the border would prove legally and practically challenging, and Biden argues he can’t crack down on crossings unless Congress passes the immigration bill. Migrants attempt to cross the Mexico-United States border along razor wire, despite heightened  Trump on Wednesday called the legislation—which is being negotiated in exchange for additional aid to Ukraine—a “stupid bill” and urged lawmakers to “make sure it doesn’t get passed,” pressuring Biden to “close the southern border” and insisting there is “no bill necessary” in a Truth Social post. Trump’s campaign has caused many of his allies in Congress to sour on the border deal, and Biden, in turn, has blamed the GOP for blocking him from executing “emergency authority” to “shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed.” The term “shutdown” is likely a form of hyperbole, as closing legal ports of entry would be an extreme and unprecedented measure that would disrupt trade and U.S.-Mexico relations, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council. Instead, many Republicans have pushed Biden to crack down on unauthorized border crossings that have hovered near record levels in recent years. No administration could automatically force universal deportations for anyone caught in the U.S. illegally, however, under what Reichlin-Melnick described as “crystal clear” immigration law that grants any foreign national on U.S. soil the right to seek asylum, which is afforded to those who can prove they faced persecution in their home countries—regardless of whether they entered the United States through legal means. Republicans have suggested Biden should drastically curtail asylum claims by reimposing more restrictive Trump-era immigration policies like Title 42 (which let federal officials rapidly expel unauthorized migrants to Mexico under the Covid-19 emergency) or the “Remain in Mexico” program (which required most asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico)—but both policies are controversial and have faced legal challenges, along with resistance from Mexico. Biden argues the legislation being negotiated in the Senate would let him effectively “shut down” the border by raising the threshold for asylum and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to limit crossings to 1,400 per day if migrant encounters exceed a threshold,     reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. It would also speed up the asylum process for people who legally present themselves at ports of entry and require people caught in the country illegally to be detained while their asylum interviews are conducted, and removed within 15 days if they fail the interview, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), one of the Senate negotiators working on the deal, explained to reporters Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), echoing Trump, has claimed Biden could automatically deport anyone who was caught crossing illegally under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which Trump used to impose the controversial travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. This too is a fraught proposal, according to Reichlin-Melnick, noting that the courts struck down Trump’s attempt to prohibit people caught violating the order from seeking asylum, a right enshrined in a patchwork of international and U.S. immigration law implemented over the past 100-some years. While the details of the border-Ukraine deal being negotiated in the Senate have been closely guarded, some Republicans—even those who are in favor of aiding Ukraine, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—have expressed outrage in recent weeks that it does not include tighter restrictions on parole, which allows migrants in emergency situations to safely and legally cross the border through airports and other official means. But the timing of the stalled negotiations aligns with Trump’s sudden interest in killing it—a fact Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)   acknowledged in a meeting with the GOP conference last week, telling lawmakers “we don’t want to do anything to undermine” Trump. Johnson   the proposed Senate bill, as is, is dead-on-arrival in the GOP controlled House, citing Republican demands for a string of more restrictive policies, including the re-implementation of “Remain in Mexico,” new limitations on asylum and parole and additional border wall construction. Former DHS officials warned that curtailing crossings to the degree reportedly proposed in the pending legislation could crowd portions of the border south of Mexico, they told  , adding the measures would only be possible with Mexico’s cooperation. What’s more, is that removing anyone who is caught on U.S. soil after crossing the border illegally would require additional asylum officers to conduct what’s known as the “credible fear process,” a pre-screening to determine if their asylum claims warrant review, Reichlin-Melnick said. Immediate detention for most people caught in the U.S. illegally, as described by Sinema, could anger Biden’s base while it also threatens to overwhelm detention facilities. 52%. That’s the share of voters who trust Trump more than Biden (30%) to handle immigration, according to a Bloomberg-Morning Consult   released Wednesday. The survey found 59% of voters rate immigration as a “very important” issue in the presidential election. Immigration policy has vexed the Biden administration throughout this tenure as the number of unauthorized crossings have surged, reaching a monthly record high in December. Many of the migrants hail from Central America, Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, and have asked for asylum from political repression or rampant gang violence. The influx follows the May expiration of the pandemic-era public health law, Title 42, that allowed border agents to turn away migrants seeking asylum on the grounds that it could lead to increased spread of Covid-19. The Biden Administration also ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy in August 2022, following a protracted court battle with Texas and Missouri. Biden promised to eliminate both policies during his 2020 campaign, and there are also practical reasons why neither are likely to be re-implemented. The Mexican government has said it will not cooperate with any reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and the Supreme Court has already ruled the Biden administration had the right to end it. Title 42 is no longer applicable since the federal public health emergency expired in May. Biden has requested funding for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers and fentanyl-detection technology as part of his proposed fiscal year 2024 budget that is under negotiation in Congress."

Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies, has invested in the Enhanced Games.  Thiel was revealed as an investor in a “multi-million dollar” seed round on Tuesday for the Enhanced Games, a privately funded sporting contest that describes itself as the “Olympics of the future.” Thiel is joined by the likes of  , a cryptocurrency investor and former CTO of Coinbase, and  , a biotech investor who said the games “will undoubtedly inspire the public’s imagination.” The Enhanced Games said it will not test athletes for drugs or other performance enhancers at its events—it is not clear when the first competition will take place—explaining it “embrace[s] the inclusion of science in sports” and is “unencumbered by anachronistic legacy systems” that are “ ” and stigmatize “enhanced athletes.” The contest   it is aiming to be the “safest international sporting event in history” and will require full medical screens on athletes competing to monitor any risks. While the “Enhanced Movement” stresses enhancements as a “personal” choice for competitors, the contest’s website says it “embraces enhanced athletes” and wants to push the “perceived limit” of what is possible, with the ultimate goal of setting new world records. Team sports have been culled from the contest to better focus on individual prowess, and events will be held across five core sporting categories: athletics, aquatics, combat, gymnastics and strength. The Enhanced Games says it is going to be the “most inclusive sports league in history.” All adults will be welcome to apply to compete in the games, organizers said, regardless of whether they are “natural, adaptive, or enhanced, an amateur or a former Olympian.” Registration will open in late 2024. Precise dates for the contest are not yet known. “Contemporary drug testing practised in sports today is not necessarily about athlete safety; it often skews the public perception of fairness and health in competitive sports,” said Michael Sagner, a member of the games’ scientific and medical advisory board and a clinician and researcher in aging and sports medicine at King’s College London. Sagner said Enhanced will adopt a “sophisticated safety protocol” that will put athletes’ health first. The Enhanced Games’ organizers say they hope to avoid the excessive waste and costs associated with the modern Olympic Games. The Enhanced Games have been designed so they can be hosted at a Division One university campus, its website said, avoiding the need to build new stadiums and push cities into debt. It will also mean athletes can be paid fairly, boasts Aron D’Souza, president of the Enhanced Games. While the Olympic Games can generate billions in revenue, successful athletes see only a   of the bounty. “By focusing on world records in popular sports such as track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weight lifting and combat sports, we can eliminate wasteful infrastructure spending and reinvest to fairly pay all athletes.” It’s not clear how much athletes competing in the Enhanced Games stand to win. The games’ organizers   an exact prize pool and compensation structure will be announced in the middle of 2024. All athletes will be paid a base salary and will compete for additional prize winnings, organizers said. By nature, competitive athletes strive to be the very best at what they do and train hard to achieve this. Inevitably, athletes look beyond themselves for ways of getting an edge, which can range from an improved diet, training at high altitudes and exploiting advances in sports medicine and psychology to high-tech gear like bikes, shoes and swimming costumes, blood doping and drugs. A number of these methods, notably using drugs, have potentially negative health consequences for athletes and are viewed as giving an unfair advantage over other competitors. While there is no clear consensus on where the dividing line is between permissible and impermissible enhancement—the boundary often changes with new scientific advances as well—high level contests frequently test athletes to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Athletes in many professional leagues can be sanctioned or barred from competition for doping, and some fans reject any   who used performance-enhancing drugs. Critics   efforts like the Enhanced Games put athletes’ health at risk and undermine the integrity and fairness of sporting competition. Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN the idea of such a contest is “farcical,” adding that it’s “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” It’s also likely illegal in many states on account of the legal status of some performance enhancers like anabolic steroids, which can help boost muscle mass, Tygart said. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was   from competing internationally for four years on Monday for an anti-doping violation from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. She had won gold in the team figure skating event, though the medal has now   to Team USA. We estimate   has a net worth of $6.2 billion. The sum positions him as the 443rd   on Forbes’ list of real-time billionaires. Thiel cofounded PayPal and big data firm Palantir and was the first big investor in Facebook.  (The Verge)"

    "content": "British Formula One star Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes at the end of the upcoming season and is set to join Ferrari in 2025, according to    , in what could be one of F1’s biggest moves in nearly a decade. Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

Trump’s lawyers had argued the dossier—which came to light days before he took office—contained false, inaccurate or fabricated information about the former president and sought damages from the company for allegedly violating British data protection laws. Steyn, in a written ruling, said there are “no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed” as Trump had “chosen to allow many years to elapse -– without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction.” There is a six-year period of “limitations” that such damages need to be claimed within, Steyn reasoned, adding that the former president’s claim for damages “is bound to fail.” Steyn, who said she did not consider or determine the veracity or accuracy of the dossier’s claims, noted that the “only other remedy” Trump sought—an order to erase, or restrict processing, of his data—was “pointless, and unnecessary,” as Orbis had already deleted its copies of the dossier and it is “freely available” online anyway.

Steele, who is British,  the decision as “reckless” and in October claimed two Russian sources had not been heard from since. Steyn said she thought Trump’s real purpose for pursuing Orbis was not for damages but as a final attempt at rehabilitating his reputation after failing for years through other means. “In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility,” Steyn wrote. Orbis had   Trump brought the claim merely to air “longstanding grievances” against the company and Steele.  (CNN)  (BBC)"

    "title": "Inside Saudi Arabia’s $800 Billion Tourism Moonshot",
    "content": "hatever your preconceived notion of Saudi Arabia as a travel destination is, it’s about to be get a major renovation. Imagine Sindalah, for example, a   with three ultra-luxe resorts, 38 high-end restaurants and multiple superyacht marinas. Or Qiddiya, a   of 600,000 people rising from the desert floor, dedicated to esports and gaming. How about Trojena, a space-age   built above the high desert? Or The Red Sea, a   of 50 luxury resorts and 8,000 hotel rooms spread across 22 islands in a Maldives-style archipelago—powered entirely by wind and solar energy? Also in the works is The Rig, a   built on an off-shore oil platform. In addition, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a major cruise destination, with   having recently bought a $300-million ship. Across the Kingdom, new roads, airports, golf courses and cruise terminals are rising from the sand. The map is literally being redrawn in real time. Then there are all the new hotels, with their thousands of freshly built rooms. The world’s most iconic hospitality companies—Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, St. Regis, Fairmont, Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and InterContinental—are falling over themselves to jump into a construction pipeline that’s churning faster than anywhere else in the world. Any one of these projects might momentarily pierce the travel industry’s fleeting attention span. But together, what’s going on in Saudi Arabia simply cannot be ignored. Indeed, it can be often difficult to visualize the vastness of Saudi Arabia’s physical transformation. Some of the most notable ongoing projects—including Sindalah, the 7-star private island, and Trojena, the improbable desert ski resort—fall within NEOM, a $500-billion built-from-scratch region in northwest Saudi Arabia where the Kingdom is creating new cities, resorts and other developments. At 10,200 square miles and bounded by the Red Sea to the south and the Gulf of Aqaba to the west, it’s roughly the size of Albania. Fantasy Island: Sindalah will feature 88 villas, 333 apartments, 51 luxury retail stores and an 86-berth superyacht marina. Bankrolled mainly by the Kingdom’s $700-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the idea for NEOM was born out of  , Saudi Arabia’s grand plan to shake off its historic reliance on oil and diversify its economy. One of the scheme’s pillars involves reinventing the country as a global tourism juggernaut. When first announced in 2016, the Kingdom’s tourism goals seemed fanciful: Attract 100 million foreign and domestic visitors to the country every year and grow tourism’s share of the economy from about 3% to 10%. Oh, and do it all in just 14 years. That aspiration seemed all the more preposterous given that, in 2016, Saudi Arabia had not yet opened its doors to international leisure travelers. At the time, travel to the Kingdom was almost entirely restricted to three types of people: expatriate workers, those with business visas, and religious pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Then in 2019,   it would provide e-visas and visas on arrival to visitors from 49 countries, including the United States. Among other changes announced at the time: Female visitors would be exempted from wearing an abaya, the traditional and otherwise obligatory head-to-toe robe, in public places and would be allowed to travel without a male companion. Tourists would still be required to dress modestly and Mecca would remain off-limits to non-Muslims. Since Saudi Arabia opened to the international travel market, the speed and spare-no-expense approach to its transformation has stunned even the most seasoned tourism analysts. “We’re seeing hugely ambitious plans, huge amounts of development,” says Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism research at  . “Billions, ultimately trillions, worth of dollars being invested in infrastructure and in diversifying their economy.” The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated the Kingdom has already spent $800 billion, and that doesn’t include the massive amounts of foreign investments pouring in. The pandemic delayed some projects, of course, but rather than scaling back expectations, the Saudis ratcheted up their goal to 150 million annual visitors by 2030. Here’s where semantics come into play. In tourism parlance, a “visitor” is defined as someone who visits a site within the country, which is very different from what Euromonitor deems an “arrival,” someone who makes an overnight stay. (Other organizations sometimes call the latter “tourists.”) Saudi Arabia had over 24 million foreign arrivals in 2023 and will welcome nearly 37 million in 2030, according to Euromonitor projections. “So if each of those 37 million overnight tourists visits three sites, you pretty much have got your 100 million visits,” Bremner says. “Then add on top of that your domestic tourists, and their own set targets are quite achievable.” A more meaningful measure of success is how much foreigners are expected to spend while in Saudi Arabia. Euromonitor predicts that international tourists will spend $38 billion in 2030. But the total economic impact for Saudi Arabia will be far greater after adding in domestic travelers’ expenditures and the ripple effect of one million new tourism jobs. The WTTC projects that, by 2032, Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector could contribute nearly $169 billion to its GDP, representing 17.1% of the total Saudi economy. Waterworld: The Red Sea Global project features several luxury resorts, including one with overwater bungalows. “Remember, they’re building this destination on the ledger, essentially from scratch, for the international market, and they are bringing in the best of the best in terms of the quality of people they’re working with” says Bremner. “I can see that they’ve thought through every single aspect of tourism, from the staff to the product, the brand, the service, the connectivity, the sustainability. So it really does feel like they’re building something for the next century ahead.” Preparing for the future also means recognizing the seismic shift in what the next generations of global travelers will want. Roughly 90% of young Chinese travelers and 70% of Gen Z travelers in the UK, Australia and India say they are looking to discover new destinations, according to data from  . In that sense, being the new kid on the tourism block is an enormous plus. “New generations have a lot more information through social media,” Billy Canellas, head of asset management at NEOM,   at the Skift Global Forum East in December. “[Younger travelers] are very well educated about the effects of overtourism in traditional destinations,” he added, noting “a clear tendency towards the eco-friendly and sustainable destinations” and an eagerness to learn about a destination’s “culture and the traditions of diversity.” “The luxury market is getting more diverse and younger, and it's shifting to the emerging markets,” says Bremner, noting that the United Arab Emirates, India and China are all highly appealing to this demographic. “We have this fresh-faced luxury traveler, and it's not the traditional older generation of travelers with lots of money. It’s the New World luxury traveler, highly digital, very environmentally conscious, and for whom social impact is important.” “Make no mistake,” says Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, “what Saudi Arabia is doing is they’re identifying who are some of the most important travelers are—the people willing to spend a lot of money on experiences—and asking, How do we go get them?” There are, of course, many ways for the Saudi grand vision to go sideways. First, there are enormous financial risks inherit in tackling so many giga projects all at once, even for a country with bottomless pockets. “The Saudis are running at 82% public debt compared to government revenue,” Bremner says, noting that official public debt as a percentage of GDP was 23.8% in 2023. Still, it’s all relative. The Kingdom’s debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly double what it was a decade ago, but still quite low compared to other countries. For example, Switzerland’s government debt is 41% of GDP. The U.S. and Canadian governments’ debt is 133% and 106% of GDP, respectively. The U.K.’s debt is 98% of GDP. Bremner’s biggest concern is hotel overcapacity, which would ultimately suppress prices. “That luxury positioning is going to come under a little bit of erosion, because [the Saudis] are moving so quickly. With that level of supply, it is quite hard to balance,” she says, adding that Euromonitor International’s latest forecast model predicts that the average traveler’s spend will have already dropped by 2030. “Too many hotel rooms that aren’t being filled will drive prices down, so that’s a risk.” Sand Dollars: A new Four Seasons is a part of Red Sea Global and will have 149 rooms and suites, a spa and an 18-hole golf course. In addition, Saudi Arabia has a persistent PR problem among many would-be travelers, especially those from the West. The Kingdom still has strict laws about drinking and severe restrictions for women, not to mention allegations of human rights abuses and attacks against journalists. In 2021, the U.S.   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of   journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But any concerns about human rights haven’t stopped multinational corporations from investing in the Kingdom’s grand vision. “For some players, it will be a very important issue, perhaps a complete barrier to entry,” says Bremner. “However, we can see that the majority of luxury hotel brands have already shifted from China and the U.A.E. into Saudi Arabia.” After all, the international travel market loves nothing more than a shiny, new destination in an emerging market and right now, the Middle East is having a moment. “You have the Middle East in the sort of perfect location,” says Bremner, “just like Turkey—within a five-hour flight of Asia and of Western Europe.” Even with the start of the Israel-Hamas War last October, the Mideast was nevertheless the fastest-growing tourism region in 2023, with international arrivals 23% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the  . That’s 35% above the global average, as the rest of the world’s tourism is, on average, still at a 12 point deficit compared to 2019 visitor volume. While just over three million American tourists visited the region in 2023—making up 12.6% of total outbound U.S. tourists—that’s a massive 39% jump from 2019. And though the Middle East’s portion of American tourists was smaller than those of Europe (40%) and Asia (15.7%) last year, it was the only one of the three regions that has grown since the pandemic, according to data from National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO), the agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks tourism statistics. But Freeman isn’t concerned about Saudi Arabia’s ability to lure large numbers of American tourists. “I'm worried about them trying to attract Europeans, high-spending Middle Easterners, and Asians, who might have otherwise come and spent their money in the United States,” he says. After all, Freeman says, international tourism is an increasingly competitive sport where one country’s gain is another’s loss: “What gives us pause,” he says, “is that other nations now realize that travel is a global competition to figure out who can attract the customer.”"

Optical microscope view of Candida auris. The Seattle and King County public health department   Tuesday it identified three confirmed cases of Candida auris infection last week, after an initial case was confirmed on January 10. Candida auris is a type of fungus that grows as yeast, and though it’s rare, it can cause severe illness and spread easily because it’s typically resistant to antifungal medications,   to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All four people were patients of Kindred Hospital Seattle, and the first confirmed case was detected through a “proactive screening program” during admission to the hospital, according to the news release from King County officials. The other three patients initially tested negative for the fungus when they were first admitted, though additional testing revealed they were positive, suggesting they were infected during their stay at the hospital. Local officials still haven’t identified the source of the outbreak, but they’re working with Kindred Hospital to keep transmissions down by keeping infected patients isolated, and notifying facilities that admit patients who were previously at Kindred. The CDC issued a   in May 2023 about an uptick of Candida auris cases spreading in healthcare facilities, labeling it an “urgent antimicrobial resistant threat.” 2,377. That’s how many Candida auris infections were reported in the U.S. in 2022—the year with the most up-to-date data—  to the CDC. Some 5,754 other people were found to have Candida auris somewhere on their body that same year, though they weren’t sick or had an active infection. Candida auris was first identified in Japan in  , where it was spotted in a patient’s ear secretion. The U.S. first began tracking infections in 2016, and it was discovered that cases dated back to 2013 in the country. Cases have since grown every year and have been reported in 36 states as of 2022, with the most drastic increase occurring during the Covid pandemic between 2020 and 2021, where the U.S. saw a 94% increase, according to CDC  . Around 95% of cases occurred in five states between 2013 and 2020: New York (41%), Illinois (26%), New Jersey (14%), California (8%) and Florida (7%). Around   of Candida auris strains are resistant to at least one antifungal, while 30% are resistant to at least two. Part of the reason the infection spreads so quickly is because it’s often   as a different fungus and not treated properly, and spreads easily through healthcare facilities. This is because the infection can live on surfaces for at least two weeks, according to a 2017   published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

South Carolina kicked off the Democratic nominating contest after the Democratic National Committee moved the state ahead of New Hampshire and Iowa on the official primary calendar—a symbolic reward to its Democratic voters who delivered Biden a resounding victory in the state in the 2020 presidential nomination, when all 46 counties voted for him. South Carolina, where early voting kicked off Jan. 22, will award 55 delegates of the 1,991 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. “The truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact,” Biden told an audience at an event in Columbia, South Carolina last month. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.” 19. That’s the number of percentage points Biden’s support among Black voters declined last year, according to a November NBC   that found his approval rating had dipped to 40% among all voters, the lowest level of his presidency. It currently stands at 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s   The Biden campaign hopes his win in South Carolina, where about 60% of Democratic voters are Black, will mobilize the key demographic in subsequent primaries and the general election. Biden is likely to face former President Donald Trump in a historic rematch in the November general election as Trump appears poised to clinch the Republican nomination after winning both the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. Biden has ratcheted up his attacks on Trump since he officially began campaigning at the start of the year, centering his talking points around contrasting himself with the former president, rather than highlighting his own record. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, repeatedly called him a “loser” over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and regularly reminds voters Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump and his Republican allies, meanwhile, accuse Biden of corruption, alleging he has improperly meddled in his son Hunter Biden and other family members’ business dealings. Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail largely surrounds his own four criminal indictments and accusing the prosecutors, without evidence, of bringing the cases in an effort to boost Biden’s reelection chances. Their rematch is expected to be a close contest, as polls show Trump leads Biden by less than two points, according to Real Clear Politics’  The next Democratic primary is Thursday in Nevada. Republicans will hold their primary the same day. No delegates will be awarded in the GOP contest and instead will go to the winner of the caucuses on Feb. 8 thanks to a new law that effectively split the state’s primary and caucuses into two separate events on different days. Trump is running in the caucuses, while former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is running in the primary. New Hampshire held its Democratic primary on Jan. 23, but the contest was unsanctioned and no delegates were awarded following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties. In protest of the new calendar, state Democrats opted to hold the primary on the same day as the GOP. Biden sided with the Democratic National Committee and did not appear on the ballot, but beat Phillips and Williamson anyway, winning 64% of votes following a successful write-in campaign."

US President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign rally to Restore Roe at Hylton Performing Arts  The race was called for Biden about an hour after polls began closing at 7 p.m. Tuesday. New Hampshire is the first state in this year’s Democratic presidential primary, consistent with tradition and in defiance of the wishes of the Democratic National Committee, which sought to make South Carolina the first-in-the-nation primary state in an effort to energize Black voters who helped secure Biden’s path to the 2020 nomination. Biden, whose incumbent status is all-but-certain to pave his path to the Democratic nomination, opted not to appear on the ballot after the state’s Democratic Party chose not to follow suit with the DNC’s new rules—but local Biden supporters urged people to write his name in. The race was considered unsanctioned by the DNC and no delegates will be awarded toward the Democratic nomination. Twenty-one candidates appeared on the ballot, including Rep.

Despite his absence from the ballot, Biden was widely expected to cruise to victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday, with the most recent Emerson College   showing him beating Phillips by 45 points. The Democratic primary was called for Biden moments after former President Donald Trump was declared the winner of the GOP primary contest, beating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Biden volunteers launched a write-in campaign in the lead-up to New Hampshire to urge voters to pen his name on ballots. The Biden campaign sided with the DNC when it chose to move South Carolina ahead of New Hampshire, declaring its primary unsanctioned and unimportant to his ability to secure the nomination since the DNC penalized New Hampshire by removing its delegates. So far, Biden has largely centered his campaign messaging around his economic accomplishments, casting Trump as a threat to democracy and abortion access. Trump, meanwhile, has hit Biden over his border policies as illegal immigration has surged during the president’s tenure and as Congress is battling over new border controls. Trump has mostly steered clear of highlighting Biden’s age (81) as Trump, 77, battles concerns about his own mental clarity and fitness to serve. 34%.

Wegovy injector pens are authorized to help people with obesity.  Novo Nordisk “started gradually increasing” supplies of lower doses of Wegovy in January, the company   Wednesday, months after it throttled provisions to “safeguard continuity of care.” The company will more than double the quantity of lower doses reaching the U.S. compared to recent months, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters in a call discussing the firm’s stellar  . Novo Nordisk will also gradually increase overall supply of the anti-obesity drug throughout the rest of 2024, the company confirmed to Forbes in an email. In its  , the drugmaker said it is exploring other ways to shore up scarce supplies of in-demand medicines, adding that it has invested nearly $11 billion in expanding global production capacity. The company said it is also “thinking strategically” about how to remove bottlenecks from its supply chain, singling out disposable auto-injector pens patients use to deliver Wegovy and other medications in its catalog. In particular, Novo said it is exploring ways to reduce reliance on “single-use injection devices,” such as introducing medicines in once-weekly, rather than daily, formulations. Novo Nordisk throttled distribution of smaller Wegovy doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients. As the drug has a risk of gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, patients are started on a smaller dose that is then increased over time to reduce any risks. The restrictions, which are still officially in place after the announcement on boosting supplies, meant many new patients could not begin treatment. Jorgensen said the increased supplies mean more U.S. patients will be able to start treatment. Novo Nordisk has been struggling to meet booming demand for Wegovy for years. The drug scored regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2021 and it has been featured on the Food and Drug Administration’s shortages list   early 2022. For much of this time, Wegovy, the brand name for a GLP-1 hormone-mimicking drug semaglutide, was the only anti-obesity drug of its kind on the market and its   has pushed Novo Nordisk to secure record profits and become one of the most valuable companies in Europe.

Adidas shares plummeted on Thursday after the company's cautious projections for 2024. Adidas’ share price plunged nearly 9% after markets opened in Europe on Thursday, before settling at $178.5 (165.44)—down 6% from the previous day. In its preliminary   for 2023, the company projected an operating profit of roughly $540 million (€500 million) for 2024—  of analyst estimates of around $1.37 billion (€1.27 billion)—because of currency fluctuations in key markets.

During the company’s earnings call, Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden referred to the cautious projections for 2024 as a “worst-case scenario” and said: “Everything we are saying is conservative.” Gulden added: “We're trying to be humble, and down-to-earth, and then rather surprise you positively than negatively.” In 2022, Adidas joined several major brands in severing ties with Kanye West after the rapper made several antisemitic remarks on social media and interviews.

    "title": "Is The 'God's Army' Border Convoy—With Only 50 Vehicles In Texas—A Bust? What To Know",
    "content": "The “Take Our Border Back Convoy” has begun driving through the southern U.S. on its way to several planned rallies near the border on Saturday in protest of the Biden administration’s migration policies—but the protest is reportedly off to a slow start, and has so far failed to pick up the hundreds of thousands organizers originally called to attend. The convoy will hold a rally near Eagle Pass, Texas, a city that has seen a huge surge in migrants  The group, which is   “God’s Army,” was organized partly by conservative radio hosts Scotty Saks and Kim Yeater, as well as former Army Lt. Col. Pete Chambers, who promoted the convoy on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s InfoWars last week and   on Tuesday. The convoy kicked off its multi-state journey in Virginia Beach on Tuesday, and is encouraging “active and retired law enforcement and military, Veterans, Mama Bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media, and LAW ABIDING, freedom-loving Americans” to join on the road. Organizers told the   at least 700,000 people would attend the rallies—but   reported only about 50 cars, trucks and RVs joined the convoy as it drove into Dripping Springs, Texas, on Thursday, noting the group is hoping to add more drivers has seen supporters cheer them on from the side of the highway (    reported seeing just a few dozen vehicles at other stops). The group has raised about $157,000 on donation platform   (it is unclear what Take Our Borders Back plans to spend the money on, and has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy insists it will not be “going to the border,” instead simply touring the border states—though one of its major rallies is scheduled to take place at the Cornerstone Children’s Ranch, a farm located just along the border in Quemado, Texas. At least one elected official, Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas)m told local news outlets he planned to attend one of the rallies, telling   in Dallas-Fort Worth the convoy “should be a peaceful movement by the American people” (Self has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy is planning three large rallies in border states on February 3: one in Quemado near Eagle Pass, Texas, one in Yuma, Arizona, and one in San Ysidro, California. “We are ready to roll into these peaceful assemblies in three cities … and we’re going to hold elected officials accountable,” organizer Scotty Saks said in an announcement video posted on alternative video hosting site Rumble. “Our borders and language and culture are being destroyed by this open border policy … We have solid ground for doing this event.” “God’s Army” is already facing internal friction,   reported on Wednesday. According to the report, multiple tires were slashed on convoy drivers’ cars while they stayed overnight at a hotel, and a person was kicked off one of the convoy’s buses and left on a highway shoulder. Convoy organizers seem to be blaming this on “individuals and groups actively spreading misinformation and lies” from inside the organization itself. “We have some legitimate intel from multiple sources that infiltrators, provocateurs plan to attack our convoy—either on the road or at our events,” Saks said in a video post on Rumble. Saks did not provide any direct evidence of these infiltrators, but said any potential instigators will face “the wrath of the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets who will be on the ground at our event.” The convoy comes as the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate Washington. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico are at an all-time high, after agents 2.4 million encounters over the course of 2024—up more than 4% from 2022, and more than 40% from 2021, according to  . The massive influx of migrants has overwhelmed CBP and the asylum system, which Republicans blame on President Joe Biden’s border policies, though Biden has denied claims of lax border enforcement and blamed the crisis on larger factors like poverty and violence in Central America. Eagle Pass, one of the towns the convoy is preparing to drive through, has become a focal point for migrants crossing the border into Texas, eventually compelling the state government to seize control of a local park and begin installing razor wire along the border. The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration was allowed to remove the razor wire, but Texas officials have since declared they will not let the federal government access the park and will keep installing wire. Last week, Biden endorsed a bipartisan bill that would give him the authority to shutter the southern border if crossings exceed a certain threshold and hire more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to more quickly process the massive amount of migrants in the region. In exchange, the bill would authorize more military aid to Ukraine—a major priority for Democrats. Despite the fact that the bill has not yet been released, President Donald Trump and House Republicans have begun attacking the proposed legislature, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) telling his colleagues the bill was “likely dead on arrival.” This week, the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who they accuse of violating his oath of office by not enforcing border security. The committee advanced the articles early on Wednesday morning, which could lead to a full House vote on the secretary’s impeachment."

    "content": "Despite a forecast for possible “life-threatening” rainfall this weekend, California emergency officials have dispelled rumors suggesting the state soon faces an ARkStorm, a hypothetical “megastorm” scenario that scientists suggest could plausibly hit California in the future with devastating rainfall and flooding. The storm is based on weather patterns from the state’s “Great Flood of 1862.” An ARkStorm—named for an atmospheric river thought of as a 1-in-1,000-year event—was developed as a weather model in 2011 and is based on weather patterns in California between 1861 and 1862, when the state suffered from the “Great Flood of 1862,”   to the U.S. Geological Survey. The ARkStorm event would draw heat and moisture from the Pacific Ocean, which then creates a series of atmospheric rivers—long, narrow bands of atmosphere—that trigger conditions similar to the “ferocity of hurricanes” over several weeks along the West Coast. If such a storm occurred, it would result in a “statewide disaster,” the USGS said, as “extensive flooding is deemed realistic” across all of California’s counties and economic sectors. Scientists would be able to “partially” predict aspects of an ARkStorm days before the storm arrives, though California’s flood protection system isn’t designed for an ARkStorm-like event, which would produce a 500-year streamflow event across most of the state, according to the USGS. A   posted to social media last week suggested California has a 30% chance of experiencing an ARkStorm-like event within the next 30 years, suggesting the state would face the “worst natural disaster in world history.” The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services responded, indicating the video was spreading misinformation and that California residents “have nothing to fear.” The state is expected to face   atmospheric river event this weekend, which the National Weather Service warned could result in “dangerous, even life-threatening impacts.” Scientists aren’t sure whether an ARkStorm or weather pattern similar to the 1862 flood will ever hit California, though the scenario is “plausible,”   to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. California’s historic rainfall and flooding between 1861 and 1862 wasn’t a “freak event,” the USGS said, as there have been at least six similar “megastorms” that have hit the state over the last 1,800 years. $725 billion. That’s the projected cost in damages if an ARkStorm ever hits California, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Of this, about $400 billion is estimated for property damage and $325 billion in losses caused by business interruption. The estimate is based on flooding that would “realistically” disrupt thousands of square miles of urban and agricultural land, subsequently resulting in thousands of landslides and disrupting “lifelines throughout the state for days or weeks.” California officials   that more than 4,000 residents—or about 1% of the state’s population—were killed by flooding between 1861 and 1862. Several areas in the state experienced dozens of inches of rainfall during the event, including the old town of Red Dog, which recorded more than 190 inches of rain between July 1, 1861 and June 30, 1862.

The tokens were issued by the Aragon Association, a Zug, Switzerland-based non-profit entity that writes software that helps run 7,500 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) managing a staggering $25 billion in crypto assets. Aragon also started a DAO of its own with the lofty if quixotic goal of creating a court system to settle disputes in the online world, and holders of ANT, as the token is known, would be eligible to be the jurors. The concept caught the eye of crypto-friendly venture-capitalist Tim Draper, whose Draper Associates bought $1 million worth of the tokens in February 2020 but has since cashed out. Tim Draper said on   at the time that this “new form of governing from Aragon” was “very exciting.” It still may be, but the   holders are not going to be part of it. They’re getting kicked to the curb as the Aragon Association, a standard-bearer for decentralized finance, did a very centralized thing: it unilaterally decided to put its assets beyond the reach of corporate activists. A group that included hedge fund Arca Investments wanted to close the gap between the approximately $200 million that Aragon had in assets in early May and the $123 million market value of ANT, trading at just over $3 a token at the time and $2 just two months prior. Arca did not respond to a request for comment sent via its website. Fearing investors could eventually control more than 50% of the votes, the association offered a take-it-or-leave it buyout of 0.0025376 ether, about $5.76, and holders have 12 months–until November of this year–to cash in. The deal will see at least $11 million and possibly much more go to a successor not-for-profit company set up by Aragon. The Aragon Association did not respond to requests for comment. There may yet be more to the story. Disgruntled ANT holders managed to get hold of $300,000 in the DAO and have used it to retain a law firm to potentially oppose Aragon’s strategy. ‘Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself.’\n\n If all of this seems like the height of 1980 corporate raider culture on Wall Street, that’s because it is. Aragon’s story illustrates that decentralization of finance and governance, where decisions are made by large numbers of individuals instead of a handful of large organizations, might be nothing more than a utopian pipe dream. Decentralization is “what you have to do if you are in crypto to attract new investors and get more legitimacy,” says Camila Russo, founder of decentralized finance-focused publication The Defiant. Much of the cryptocurrency business just mimics what already exists in traditional finance but with an alluring high-tech narrative.  the Aragon Association was meant to be a “token-governed digital jurisdiction,” according to its  , a kind of constitution for crypto projects. It aimed to create a “decentralized court” to manage user conflicts beyond what is programmable into smart contracts, the self-executing agreements that are the basis for decentralized finance. Clients for its management software included  , the dominant crypto-staking service, and metaverse provider  . The association raised $25 million through the sale of the ANT token in May 2017, followed by a   that declared it would create free, open-source technology to allow the management of DAOs as part of its “fight for freedom.” But it wasn’t until January 2023 that the Aragon DAO was launched, with the intention that it become the organization’s governing body and keeper of its funds–including the proceeds of the ANT sale, which still were held by the association. Throughout that year, the goal was to slowly move the assets to the DAO, says a source familiar with the inner workings of the organization. “There was pressure both internally and externally to be a DAO building technology for DAOs.” Ironically, the provider of voting technology for decentralized organizations found that complete decentralization was not necessarily efficient. “We’re so fixated on this one avenue of trying to decentralize,” says Anthony Leutenegger,  , a new company made up of the DAO’s development team. “Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself.” Leutenegger says Aragon X will be restructuring into a traditional Switzerland-based not-for-profit company in November when the redemption period for the ANT tokens ends. He said his team was not part of the Aragon Association board and could not address the legalities of the DAO dissolution. The company’s rationale for forcing out the ANT holders was that Swiss law required it. Describing the activists as “a coordinated group,” the association said in a May 9  , “Evidence indicates that their involvement is aimed at extracting value from Aragon for financial profit. The Aragon treasury was established with the explicit mission of supporting builders to advance decentralized governance infrastructure.” The intention was to make ANT a utility token under Swiss regulations, with the stated purpose of “providing holders of the token permissionless, trustless, and censorship-resistant decentralized governance participation in working towards the mission of the Aragon project.” Turn the social mission into a profit-making enterprise, Aragon contends, and that could “result in regulatory enforcement actions.” For its part, Arca said in an   that while Aragon’s goals are “ambitious and noble” that “in order to unlock future utility and governance value, there must be recognition of the financial value or risk dissolution.” It proposed Aragon buy ANT tokens to drive up their price, similar to a stock repurchase in the equity market. Arca ended up getting the buyback it sought but found the terms “bittersweet.” The deal provides $11 million to fund a new not-for-profit that will take over the DAO’s intended position, but if any ANT is not tendered by November, it becomes worthless and Aragon keeps the funds. Arca reckoned in a November   on its website that 25-35 percent of the outstanding tokens would not be redeemed, leaving $43.5 million to $61.4 million of assets for the new company. Over half of the ANT tokens, about 17.4 million, had been handed in so far, according to data from  . The dustup with Arca came just after the Aragon Association transferred the first funds to the Aragon DAO, totaling $300,000. Remaining ANT holders opted to engage Patagon Management, an investment firm with a track record of litigating against DAO founding teams and grant it the $300,000, with an eye to undertaking negotiations with or legal action against Aragon. ANT tokens taken from the DAO were “being taken at the direct expense of investors with no legal basis,” Patagon, which did not respond to requests for comment,  . “It is in our opinion papered over, beautified theft.”  been the driving philosophy for thousands of entrepreneurs and developers since the introduction of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto, its mysterious creator whose identity is  ,   a peer-to-peer payment system that would rely on cryptographic proofs to validate transactions, replacing intermediaries like banks and brokers. That concept gave rise to an entire industry, with cryptocurrencies now worth almost $1.7 trillion, that relies on distributed ledgers to exchange, trace and establish ownership of assets including everything from physical assets like precious metals and real estate to digital money itself. Companies like JPMorgan, Samsung and Tencent use the underlying   in supply-chain management, data security and digital-identity verification. As recently as 2021 and 2022, at the peak of crypto’s latest bull run, venture-capital investors poured nearly $50 billion into the blockchain-based economy, according to PitchBook. How did these companies end up with more liabilities or debt than they could handle in the first place? The simple answer is they offered enticingly high yields.\n “Parties agreeing to conduct transactions openly and transparently on the blockchain, as opposed to backroom deals by opaque, human, potentially-conflicted financial actors, is the vision we should be striving for, rather than clinging on to inefficient centralized financial systems,” wrote Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of blockchain-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, in a  , contending that decentralized finance, or DeFi, offered better protections to investors than centrally managed companies. At about the same time, however, crypto brokerage Voyager and digital-loan company Celsius, filed for bankruptcy amid the collapse in cryptocurrency prices that disrupted their business models. Morehead considers the failures to be a strength of DeFi–in the case of Celsius, for example, the business was forced by smart contracts to pay down loans to lenders to preserve collateral–but an opposing view would be that inflexible automated agreements that do not allow for changing conditions are no way to run an industry. How did these companies end up with more liabilities or debt than they could handle in the first place? The simple answer is they offered enticingly high yields. At the time when banks and their newfangled neobank rivals offered 4-5% rates on high-yield savings accounts, DeFi lenders paid  . But a series of hacks and crises in both DeFi and the broader industry, culminating in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in November 2023, rattled investors. The amount of cryptocurrencies held in DeFi projects now rests at $54.7 billion—below that of a mid-sized regional bank—compared with a peak of about $179 billion in November 2021, according to data aggregator DeFi Llama. While the decline can be mainly ascribed to the drop in cryptocurrency prices, it also is the true that increased interest rates on low-risk assets such as Treasuries as governments withdraw pandemic-related support to their markets are diminishing the appeal of DeFi. A bigger issue is that the decentralization concept seems better in theory than practice. One reason is that blockchain projects can be hijacked if a single entity or a group of allies controls more than half of the computing power or rights to validate network transactions. In this scenario, known as a 51 percent attack, bad actors could prevent new transactions or reverse settled ones, or they could send the same tokens to multiple recipients, which potentially would be fatal to the entire blockchain. Aragon suggested that something similar occurred when it transferred its first batch of ANT tokens to its DAO, saying in its May 9 blog post that it had suffered a “coordinated social engineering and 51% attack.” This is not exactly the same as such an attack on a blockchain because DAOs are meant to be governed by their token holders, but Aragon’s decision to take matters into its own hands to satisfy what it sees as legal requirements shows how real-world concerns can limit pure decentralization. “​​Full decentralization in DeFi is illusory,” wrote economists at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in a   of the industry. “DeFi platforms have an element of centralization, which typically revolves around holders of ‘governance tokens’ (often platform developers) who vote on proposals, not unlike corporate shareholders.” Decisions on major DeFi projects typically do not pass without support from their founders and financial backers, Andre Cronje, founder of Yearn.Finance, a yield farming robo-advisor, told   in 2022. “As much as there is talk of decentralization, unless it is back-channeled there will be no approval.” That year, researchers from the University of Luxembourg did   on tokenized voting at nine big DeFi projects and discovered that rights “are highly concentrated,” and their exercise “is very low.” Unlike voting for common stocks, there is no mandate to notify token holders of upcoming votes, and for those who store their DeFi tokens on exchanges like Coinbase there isn’t even a mechanism to allow voting. “DeFi has evolved in a much more centralized way than expected,” says The Defiant’s Russo. “You see this centralization in governance (usually a small team making most of the decisions), in the distribution of token ownership—most tokens are owned by teams and a few VCs. Then there's kind of a technical centralization, like the presence of backdoors in smart contracts.” But “this theater of decentralization is not necessary,” she adds. “I think everyone can understand that there's a progression towards this decentralization ideal” and that “you can’t be fully decentralized from the start. I would just push for all of these protocols to be more upfront about their degree of centralization. There’s a way to grow in a more transparent way.”  are adding to DeFi’s woes. In June, a U.S. judge granted a default judgment in favor of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against the decentralized collective Ooki DAO, ruling that it was a “person” under the law and was therefore liable for illegally operating a trading platform and unlawfully acting as a futures dealer. The organization was ordered to pay $643,542 and shut itself down. “The founders created the Ooki DAO with an evasive purpose and with the explicit goal of operating an illegal trading platform without legal accountability,”   Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s enforcement director. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.” None of the DAO members have responded to the summons nor appeared in court, and the founders of predecessor organization bZeroX–identified in a   as Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner–have not responded to a request for comment. Multiple friend-of-the-court briefs filed on Ooki's behalf argued that DAOs should not be treated as a singular entity. “The reason why the amicus effort was so important is that if a DAO member steps up and says ‘Hey, I'm a member of the DAO, I want to defend this,’ they're putting themselves in the crosshairs,” says Gabriel Shapiro, a lawyer who was involved in filing one of the briefs in support of Ooki. More importantly, he adds, “100% of DeFi would be illegal under CFTC’s reasoning. Why? Well, pretty much all of DeFi involves margin, financing or leverage.” Beyond DAOs, authorities have also gone after open-source software like crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which enables users to conceal digital transactions. In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)   the service, claiming that it had been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019, including $455 million allegedly stolen by North Korean hackers. A few days later, Dutch authorities arrested one of the alleged founders of Tornado, Alexey Pertsev, on money laundering charges. He remains in the Netherlands, where his trial is scheduled for March. The following year, U.S. prosecutors charged two more Tornado developers, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm. While Semenov is at large and believed to be in Dubai,   blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, Storm is under house arrest at his Washington home, Coindesk has  . His trial is set for September. On January 22, Storm   a video on X in which he asked for donations that would help fund his and Pertsev’s defense. “My legal team and I are going to put forth a strong defense at trial, not just for my family's sake, but for the future software developers and financial privacy,” said Storm. The campaign titled “Open Source Is Not A Crime” has already raised  . Storm and Semenov have not responded to requests for comment. Here too, the industry pushed back. “OFAC’s action sets a dangerous new precedent that drastically exceeds their authority and jeopardizes law-abiding Americans’ right to privacy,” said Marisa Coppel, senior counsel at the non-profit Blockchain Association, in a   accompanying the organization’s second amicus brief in support of Tornado Cash. “OFAC must see Tornado Cash for what it is: a tool that can be used by anyone. Rather than sanctioning a tool with a lawful purpose, OFAC should remain focused on the bad actors that misuse such tools.”  setbacks and regulatory pushback, decentralized systems remain popular in the cryptocurrency world. Decentralization has been more of “a means to an end—what can you do as a developer building on these new platforms that you couldn’t have done before?” asks  , cofounder of blockchain governance platform Llama. After all, “the only way to arrive at the best organizational structures is to try a lot of different things and see what works and what doesn’t.” , cofounder of Syndicate, an infrastructure provider for blockchain-based internet products, says, “Looking at it over a very long-term timescale, the decentralized tech will always be less efficient and less usable than its centralized counterparts. At the end of the day, storing data on one system that is trusted, like the database, will always be more efficient than storing data on 10,000 nodes that are widely distributed. “But if we harness the benefits of this, we will get to the point where I think the downsides become less noticeable and the upsides become much more present. ​​If we do encode certain guarantees, like the ability to not change fees overnight, then we've created a better world.”"

Apple CEO Tim Cook appears next to his company's Vision Pro virtual reality headset, which will  Apple tallied $119.6 billion of revenue and $2.18 earnings per share (or $33.9 billion total net income) in the final three-month period of 2023, topping average analyst estimates of $118 billion in sales and $2.10 of profit per share ($32.7 billion total profit), respectively, according to FactSet. That marks 2% revenue growth from 2022’s December quarter and 16% profit expansion, figures far more paltry than those just reported by rivals   (18% increase in sales, 33% jump in net income) and   (13% rise in sales, 52% expansion of profits). Apple’s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales—its $69.7 billion of iPhone revenue last quarter marked just a 6% annual increase but topped forecasts of $67.6 billion—and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region which accounted for about a fifth of all Apple revenue last fiscal year. Shares of Apple dipped slightly in low-volume afternoon trading, declining 4% over the last week’s standard trading hours. Apple’s lukewarm earnings report comes two days after Microsoft   its fifth-consecutive quarter of record revenue and two weeks after Apple ceded the title of the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft, a crown held by Apple since 2021. Apple’s roughly $130 billion in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat Microsoft’s $113.6 billion, but analysts project Microsoft to become more profitable than Apple by next fiscal year, a fairly remarkable feat considering Apple raked in 33% more EBITDA during the 2022 fiscal year. Wall Street expects Microsoft’s valuation ($3 trillion as of Thursday) to accordingly surge further past Apple’s ($2.9 trillion). Analysts’ average price target for Apple stock of $199 implies a projected market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, according to FactSet, while their average price target for Microsoft implies a projected market cap of $3.4 trillion."

    "content": "wning a sports team has long been a goal of the ultra-rich, but expanding that into an empire—with multiple teams across various leagues—is a winning strategy for creating generational wealth. Having a portfolio of teams allows an owner to sell cross-sponsorships, develop mixed-use real estate and expand into new distribution channels with greater ease. A sports empire can also take the pressure off any single team a sports owner has, acting as a hedge for rebuilding years. And it almost always pays off. In 2024, the 25 most valuable sports empires in the world have an aggregate enterprise value of $216 billion—or an average of $8.6 billion—which represents an increase of 24% from a year ago. The main reason for the rise? Team values have been growing at a robust pace. On average, the 124 teams in MLB, the NBA, the NFL and the NHL went up 21% in value in 2023 versus the prior year. All of which has made it much harder to earn a place on this annual ranking—the cutoff this year is $4.95 billion, 38% higher than a  . The biggest gainer on this year’s empires list is Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, up 155% from last year to $11.9 billion thanks mainly to Josh Harris’ purchase of the Washington Commanders in July for a record $6.05 billion. HBSE now effectively runs a group of assets from many of the world’s most popular sports: the NFL (Commanders), the NBA (Philadelphia 76ers), the NHL (New Jersey Devils), the English Premier League (Crystal Palace), Nascar (Joe Gibbs Racing) and youth sports (Ripken Baseball). Another smart way to monetize sports empires is to build them up big and then slim them down. Take Liberty Media, for instance, whose most valuable sports property is the   auto-racing series. The aggregate value of Liberty’s ownership stakes in its sports assets fell 12%, to $18.2 billion, but it still maintains the top spot on our list. Liberty declined in value over this past year because it spun off the Atlanta Braves (current enterprise value:  ) in July. Betting with Liberty’s longtime chairman, John Malone, would have been a smart move. Had an investor purchased shares of the Braves when they were offered as a tracking stock in 2016, the value of the stock would be up 131%—versus 118% for the S&P 500 over the same period. In November, the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System acquired a 5% stake in Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment—the parent company of the NHL’s Toronto Maple Leafs, the NBA’s Toronto Raptors and MLS’s Toronto FC—with its   from Larry Tanenbaum at an $8.4 billion valuation.

The Buffalo Bills are scheduled to open their new stadium in 2026, and Jacobs’ Delaware North (which handles foodservice for the team) will likely make the move with the franchise. Aside from owning the Los Angeles Kings, AEG owns (or has stakes in) arenas across the globe that support multiple teams. Crypto.com Arena, for example, is home to Los Angeles’ Lakers, Clippers and Kings, who combined play more than 125 games there each season.

And if you believe that Messi, Suarez, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and company represent the most talent ever compiled on a single MLS roster, then you have to believe that Miami has a chance to make a deep run and potentially win the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup. Using  , one potential course to the CCC title could see the Herons travel a total of 27,918 flight miles between late February and the time they return from a hypothetical final at Club America in Mexico City on June 2. This after they’ve already spent much of late January and early February at 35,000 feet. That’s a grueling stretch for any professional club, let alone one whose four best players will all be entering their age 34 or older season in 2024. It could be even longer depending how other CCC results shake out. (The disaster scenario is having to face the Vancouver Whitecaps in a two-leg semifinal.) And it doesn’t include Lionel Messi’s likely return to Argentina to play for his national team during the March international window, which will register even more miles on his personal odometer. Adding on another 23,000 miles before a single meaningful match is played will almost certainly result in an unexpected swoon for the Herons at some point. Virtually every single MLS club that has made a deep continental run has seen their domestic form suffer. And while none had Messi at their disposal, virtually all of them had a much younger roster core than Miami’s ex-Barcelona quartet. Herons owner Jorge Mas has made no secret about wanting to use his side’s star-power to generate revenue, and the preseason is a reflection of that. It’s also a reasonable desire given how costly the team has been to assemble. But the tactics in that pursuit force an examination of the difference between generating revenue and building a brand. Traveling the globe is almost certainly the right call to do the former, but the answer is less clear about the latter. With all those important continental games, Miami could’ve instead chosen a relatively modest preseason regiment with a focus on trying to be at their best in continental competition. Winning that competition — and Miami are bound to be among the favorites — would pave the way to competing in the first-ever 32-team FIFA Club World Cup on U.S. soil in 2025 while Messi is still under contract. And a strong showing there would likely do a lot more to build the staying power of the Inter Miami name brand after Messi has departed. That’s is far from a guarantee, through, and Miami has understandably chosen the more certain route to revenue. Just don’t be surprised if we’re looking back on Messi’s MLS tenure five years from now wondering, “What if they hadn’t?”"

The fate of a bipartisan border deal in the Senate has been in flux amid criticism from Trump, who on   Thursday said that any senate border deal would be “meaningless” and a political “Gift to the Radical Left Democrats,”   initially casting doubts about whether a deal could be reached. Even if it passed the Senate, the border deal would likely face an uphill climb gaining support from congressional Republicans who back Trump—House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)   told colleagues in a letter this week that the deal would be “dead on arrival.” The border is a key issue for both Trump and Biden—likely set for a rematch in November for the presidency if current results and polling in the Republican primaries hold.

It appears that Congress is about to miss two singular opportunities to make history and strengthen America internally and internationally for the sake of handing Donald Trump the opportunity to make immigration his focus in the upcoming Presidential election. After months of in depth bipartisan negotiations to address what many regard as one of the most difficult domestic issues that has plagued Congress for decades, a deal appeared to be within reach. The discussions touched not only on border security, but the other important immigration questions that have been awaiting resolution, such as the Dreamers, H1B visa reform, temporary work issues including agricultural workers, asylum claims, the use of humanitarian parole, and a path to citizenship for long-term undocumented immigrants. As the   put it, “For months, Senate Republicans have been working with Democrats on a deal they have described as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a conservative border security bill, and for weeks, they have hinted that they are tantalizingly close to an agreement.” But then former President Donald Trump intervened causing Republican support to recede because he indicated that he wanted to campaign on the immigration question in the next Presidential election. On the international front, Trump’s intervention also scuttled a deal to provide American allies, especially Ukraine the financial aid it needs to repel the invasion of Russia, but also financial aid for Israel and Taiwan. Trump claims he can   — a promise that has  . They fear that Trump’s simplistic plan would involve the U.S. attempting to cede Ukrainian land to Russia. While he was President, many observers have forgotten that there was an ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the eastern front. Despite his claimed friendship with Putin he was unable to resolve it. If he could not resolve it then, how can he claim to be able to resolve the war now? Anyone familiar with European history can see that today’s political situation eerily parallels the events that led up to the outbreak of World War II. Putin’s invasion of Crimea and later occupation of the Donbas, and his current invasion of Ukraine parallels Hitler’s invasion of Austria and military invasion of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia before his declaration of war on Poland. But today’s situation in Europe is far graver than at the outset of World War II because of the existence of nuclear weapons. The proposed budgetary allocation of $ 60 billion for Ukraine has been stalled by linking it to immigration and the lack of agreement on defending the southern border. This is a  in the international arena. It is not a question of   Ukraine a gracious gift but a question of America living up to its  . In that accord America made a promise to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal, then the third largest in the world,  . If  American allied countries in NATO, and others such as Taiwan, and South Korea, would seriously question whether America can be relied on as an ally when it counts. Ever! Indeed, as EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell, in an interview with   put it, “The European Union’s existence is at stake in Ukraine.” He added, “Putin is not determined to stop full-scale aggression anytime soon, and the danger emanating from “a great power [Russia] Democratic and GOP lawmakers and leadership aides believe that there’s still majority support for more Ukraine money among lawmakers. But the problem is how does Congress pass it. Trump has called Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP senators repeatedly to pressure them to oppose the bipartisan bill. Right-wing media have also slammed it on Trump’s behalf. Johnson continues to call on Biden to take executive action to stem illegal border crossing while also pushing the Republican hard line H.R. 2, House border security bill. No Democrats back that bill. The result is that there is no resolution to immigration issues, the American southern border is no safer and there is no aid for Ukraine forthcoming. America’s future as a leading world power flounders in the face of these two significant challenges."

    "title": "Ozempic Maker Novo Nordisk Beats Profit Forecasts As Weight-Loss Sales Soar",
    "content": "Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings for 2023, propelled by a tsunami of demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs as new treatments emerge and compete for a slice of the growing market. Sales of Wegovy, an injectable prescription weight loss medicine, has helped boost profits for Novo  Novo Nordisk reported $33.7 billion of sales for 2023, an increase of 36% at constant exchange rates and beating analysts’ expectations. Full-year operating profit also exceeded analysts’ expectations, climbing 44% at constant exchange rates to $15 billion. Diluted earnings per share rose 52% to 18.61 Danish kroner ($2.7). Around 90% of the drugmaker's overall sales—$31.2 billion—came from its obesity and diabetes care division, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively authorized to treat diabetes and obesity. Sales of GLP-1 diabetes medications—a class that includes Ozempic—and in obesity care were largely responsible for this uptick, Novo Nordisk said, rising 52% and 154% at constant exchange rates, respectively. Novo Nordisk shares rose around 4% during early trading on Wednesday morning. \"We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. “Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.\" The stellar success of Ozempic and Wegovy—both branded drugs containing the same active ingredient, semaglutide—has rapidly propelled Novo Nordisk into a rarified club of extraordinarily valuable companies and triggered an acknowledged   for a company of its size. It now has a market value of around $480 billion, up from around $310 billion at the start of 2023, $250 billion at the start of 2022 and around $160 billion at the start of 2021. With such fast growth, Novo Nordisk recently dethroned French luxury goods firm LVMH as Europe’s most valuable public company and its market value is larger than the annual economic output of its home country, Denmark. Officials there are  over the country’s reliance on a single firm and   into the same trap as Finland when it hitched its wagon to erstwhile phone giant  . Semaglutide mimics the action of a hormone—GLP-1—that is responsible for regulating appetite and blood sugar. It has been shown to help facilitate weight loss and studies suggest it could bestow other health benefits in areas like heart and kidney disease as well. While it is far from the first drug shown to reduce weight, it does not appear to be accompanied by the same litany of often serious side effects as previous generations of weight loss drugs. Experts have therefore hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity, one of our era’s most pressing public health problems. For several years, Novo Nordisk has been the sole provider of GLP-1 generation of weight loss drugs and it has heavily struggled to meet booming demand. It was recently   by Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound injections—a branded name for tirzepatide, the same ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro—are also expected to become bestsellers. Analysts believe the anti-obesity market could become one of the most lucrative opportunities for the pharmaceutical sector in its history and could   be worth as much as $100 billion by the end of the decade and   much more. Adjacent industries like wellness,  , and fitness are reportedly   the popularity of weight loss drugs will eat into revenues. Novo Nordisk said it expects solid growth for the year ahead as well, with sales expected to climb as much as 26% and operating profit as much as 29% at constant exchange rates.  (FT)"

    "title": "Democrats’ Memo Reveals 2024 Strategy: Attack GOP For ‘Election Denialism’",
    "content": "The Democratic party plans to focus its 2024 messaging on attacking Republicans who have supported former President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims of election fraud, according to a memo shared Wednesday—as President Joe Biden’s re-election campaign also announced he will cast Trump as a threat to democracy in a major campaign speech Saturday. US President Joe Biden steps off Air Force One upon arrival at Henry E. Rohlsen Airport in  Predicting election denialism will cost Republicans in the 2024 election, the memo highlights GOP losses in the 2022 midterm, including four Trump-endorsed failed Senate candidates who spread his false claims that the election was stolen, races that cost the GOP the Senate majority. The DNC led the memo, first reported by  , by calling out House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) for his role in helping Trump contest the results of the 2020 presidential election, when Johnson helped devise a debunked legal theory that suggested results in some states were invalid because they had changed their voting rules to accommodate for pandemic-era restrictions. Johnson, the memo warned, will leverage Republicans’ power in the House to “advance Donald Trump’s political ambitions in 2024” with the help of Trump allies in Congress, including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and newly minted Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good (R-Va.). Calling election denialism “the defining litmus test for the GOP presidential field,” the memo also rebukes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for campaigning on behalf of GOP midterm candidates who denied the results of the 2020 presidential election and DeSantis for refusing to say Jan. 6 was an insurrection. Biden will deliver a speech Saturday to mark the third anniversary of Jan. 6 from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where the Continental Army re-emerged from its winter encampment as a well-organized force equipped to challenge the British Army. Biden will draw parallels between the significance of the site and the 2024 election to the fate of American democracy and remind voters of Trump’s efforts to contest the 2020 election results, his campaign said. The speech is one of Biden’s most significant re-election campaign events to date and comes less than two weeks before the primaries kick off on Jan. 15 with the Iowa caucuses. Biden will travel to South Carolina Monday to deliver a speech at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the historic Black church where nine worshippers were killed by a white supremacist in a 2015 mass shooting. While Trump has continued to wield outsize power over the Republican party since losing the 2020 election, there are some signs Trump has negatively impacted the party as his preferred candidates have lost a series of high-stakes congressional races in recent years. The losses cost Republicans the Senate and a wider majority in the House in the 2022 midterms. Trump is expected to secure the GOP nomination and face Biden in the general election, and while polls show most Americans don’t want to see either on the ballot in November, an increasing number of surveys show that Americans trust Trump more than Biden to manage both the economy and the Israel-Hamas war, two major issues for voters in 2024. The expected rematch is likely to be a close race, with Trump polling 2 points ahead of Biden, according to RealClearPolitics’  , though it’s unclear how the outcome of Trump’s various criminal cases could impact his chances at winning the election. Trump faces a total of 91 criminal charges across his four indictments linked to his involvement in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, his handling of classified documents after leaving office and his Manhattan Criminal Court case accusing him of orchestrating unlawful hush money payments. It’s unclear how a conviction in any of the cases could sway voters or whether the cases will even reach a trial before November. Some surveys show the majority of voters, 58%, according to a recent  /Siena College  , believe Trump committed serious federal crimes, 62% of Republicans also believe he should remain the party’s nominee, if he wins the primary and is subsequently convicted of a crime. Whether Democrats’ plans to cast Republicans as a threat to democracy will sway voters. The economy is consistently ranked as the top issue for voters, with 75% of survey respondents in a December Associated Press/NORC   naming it as extremely or very important, compared to 67% who said the same about the future of democracy in the U.S. 62%. That’s the share of Americans who said they believe Biden was legitimately elected, down from 69% in December 2021, according to a December  University of Maryland  , indicating growing Republican loyalty to Trump."

    "title": "Trump’s Latest Liability: Court Monitor Flags Potential Multimillion Dollar Fraud, Prompting Trump Anger—Here’s What’s At Stake",
    "content": "Lawyers for former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants in a civil fraud case lashed out Monday at the court-appointed monitor overseeing the Trump Organization’s financials, accusing the monitor of making up “errors” after she flagged various “deficiencies”—and suggested Trump made up a fake $48 million loan. Former President Donald Trump sits in the courtroom during his civil fraud trial at New York Supreme  Retired judge Barbara Jones was   to oversee the Trump Organization’s financial activities and statements after New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the ex-president and his company for fraud in November 2022, accusing Trump and his company of fraudulently misstating the value of their assets on financial statements for personal gain. Jones submitted a report to the court on Friday,   that while the defendants in the case “have been cooperative” with her oversight, she’s identified “deficiencies” in materials she’s reviewed, “including disclosures that are either incomplete, present results inconsistently, and/or contain errors,” and which reflect “reflect a lack of effective governance” at the company. Trump attorney Clifford S. Robert responded to Jones’ report in a   to the court Monday, accusing her of overstating minor issues and “twist[ing]  immaterial accounting items into a narrative favoring her continued appointment, and thereby the continued receipt of millions of dollars in excessive fees.” Jones’ letter also gained attention for noting in a footnote that while Trump recorded a $48 million loan for his  , the Trump Organization told her such a loan “never existed”—a disclosure legal experts told   could get the ex-president into legal trouble, either for making a false entry on his financial disclosures, or for tax evasion, if he were found to have invented a loan to avoid income taxes. Robert called Jones’ claim about the Chicago loan a “demonstrable falsehood” and a “deliberate mischaracterization” in his letter to the court, claiming the Trump Organization never told Jones that the loan didn’t exist, but rather just that “no liabilities or obligations are outstanding” under the loan. Jones’ criticisms about the Trump Organization’s financials come as Judge Arthur Engoron prepares to announce a verdict as soon as this week in the ongoing fraud case against Trump and his company, so anything suggesting the Trump Organization is improperly managing their finances could influence the judge as he decides what penalties the defendants should face. Engoron is set to issue a verdict in the   as soon as this week, as he said he aimed to come out with his decision by the end of January. The judge has already found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud by misstating valuations, but he still has to determine whether they’re liable for other infractions—like insurance fraud and falsifying records—and whether the fraud was done intentionally. James has asked Engoron to impose a  , including a $370 million fine and barring Trump from New York’s real estate industry, but the verdict will also likely determine Jones’ fate as the company’s monitor. James has asked Engoron to extend Jones’ term as monitor for at least five years, while Robert opposed that on Monday. “Further oversight is unwarranted and will only unjustly enrich the Monitor as she engages in some ‘Javert’ like quest against the Defendants,” Robert told the court, referring to the antagonist in the book and musical “Les Miserables.” James has accused Trump and his business associates—including his sons—of fraudulently misstating the value of their assets on financial statements more than 200 times between 2011 and 2021. The attorney general’s office alleges the ex-president and his colleagues did so knowingly in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. While the case went to trial starting in October, Engoron appointed the independent monitor a year earlier, soon after James’ lawsuit was filed, and Jones previously filed a   in November saying the Trump Organization made $40 million in transfers without informing her. In her letter to the court Friday, Jones accused Trump and his co-defendants of a series of issues that included minor math errors, falsely claiming the Trump family owned something that was actually controlled by Trump’s trust, calculating values differently from document to document and failing to include some required information in financial documents. The monitor also noted the company’s projected income and expenses for its property at 40 Wall Street for 2023 were “materially different” from its actual income and expenses the previous year. Trump’s loan in Chicago has been a mystery for years. The then-candidate recorded an “over $50 million loan” against the Chicago tower on his financial disclosure in 2015, which he said he owed to Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC—a company that he himself owns. Forbes   in 2020 that financial records show Trump doesn’t actually seem to pay any interest on the loan, however, and lists Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC as having no value, which is confusing given that it should theoretically have more than $50 million in value if it’s issued a $50 million loan. “There should be an offsetting entry somewhere,” Harvard real estate professor Richard Peiser told Forbes at the time. “I can’t explain that.” Jones is the latest person involved with the civil fraud case to draw Trump and his associates’ ire, as the ex-president has attacked the case against him as a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Trump has already repeatedly attacked Engoron, James and Engoron’s clerk in the fraud trial, resulting in a gag order being imposed on him that barred him from speaking publicly about court staff—and led to him facing $15,000 in fines.

    "title": "Shell Bay: Golf’s Newest $1 Million Club Towers Above Miami Market",
    "content": "An aerial rendering of the new Shell Bay development in the Miami area, a private enclave that has a  “There are way more people who want an amazing golf experience in the Miami region than there are available amazing golf experiences,” explains Alex Witkoff, the co-CEO of the Witkoff Group and a developer of one of the most unique new private clubs in the world. In Hallandale Beach, Florida, just north of Miami, the Shell Bay Club is tucked on a prime piece of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. And golf is the focal point of the 150-acre luxury development, with a new championship course that demonstrates the delicate balance between supply and demand in a major market. Shell Bay is the first private club in the Miami area in more than two decades and the price of membership for what its founders are calling a “generational opportunity” is well over $1 million. And there’s a waiting list to get in. “People want the best of the best and, given that there hadn't been an experience like this delivered in a few decades and it won't be replicated, the response has been extraordinary,” said Ari Pearl, the founder and president of PPG Development, another founding partner in the Shell Bay project. “It’s been global in nature,” added Pearl, who has been a prominent figure in the South Florida real estate and development industry for more than two decades. “We have people from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles. Also internationally, Europe and Asia, in addition to locally in Miami.” Greg Norman's design team has created a completely new course at the Shell Club just north of Miami.  The game of golf is unquestionably booming in popularity in recent years, but Shell Bay epitomizes the challenge of preserving golf on exceptionally valuable real estate in the heart of a crowded metropolitan market. Consider that Melreese Country Club, about 20 miles away and the only municipal golf course in Miami (one of the most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the country), closed for good last year in favor of a redevelopment project that will include a Major League Soccer stadium, hotels, an office park, and a retail area with shops and restaurants. It’s a massive project, one that will create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in rent payments to the city over the life of a 99-year lease. Melreese had a storied history and was a successful and beloved public golf course, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual net revenues for the city. But what is the realistic lifespan for a facility in such a prime location, on land next to Miami International Airport? In that case, and with the push and pull between supply and demand, it was demand for land that won out over the demand for golf – due to dollars signs. So, to make golf at Shell Bay Club viable in such a prime location, it’s become an outlier in several respects. The first is the cost to get in. Golf is the centerpiece to the new Shell Bay Club, a luxury development just north of Miami. It's  At well over $1 million, Shell Bay has one of the most expensive membership buy-ins of any golf club in the nation, the byproduct of what Witkoff says is a “vicious dearth” of golf in the market. “Land is very hard to accumulate in South Florida,” he said. “I don't see this ever being able to be replicated in the Miami region because I don't see where else you would get this amount of land close to the ocean. So, for us there was a kind of once in a generation opportunity to deliver a state-of-the-art golf facility and then with so much more — residences, tennis and so on and so forth.” Among the luxury amenities at Shell Bay, which is also partnering with Auberge Resorts to provide a 60-room boutique hotel and spa on property, is a tennis facility run by the renowned Bryan brothers that has courts with all four grand slam surfaces, not to mention pickleball and Padel courts. There’s a basketball court, batting cages, bowling alleys, a billiard room, and a 48-slip yacht club. Rendering of the private, multimillion dollar residences that overlook the new golf course at Shell  But the centerpiece is the golf course. There was once another course on the property, part of the old Diplomat Golf Resort. That’s long gone, as all the original holes were blown up and sand-capped, with Greg Norman’s team adding elevation changes and creating a completely new design – one that includes an 18-hole championship course and a 9-hole Par 3 layout, along with a 12-acre, state-of-the-art practice facility. Every lake on property was moved, so Shell Bay’s golf course really was reconstructed from the subgrade up, and with 4,000 new trees added (along with 1,000 different plant species) every playing corridor has completely changed from what was there before. More than 4,000 new trees were planted at the Shell Bay Club as part of the complete reconstruction  With a variety of risk-reward shot-making options and waterfront challenges, the new course can stretch to over 7,200 yards, making it one of the longest in golf-rich South Florida. The property was designed with visions of hosting a professional tournament in mind — with contoured greens and sweeping Australian sandbelt-style bunkers — and the Norman ties certainly make a future LIV Golf event in Miami market a distinct possibility, especially when you consider that LIV golfers like Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and Lee Westwood are members. Another unique element of the Shell Bay project that’s made keeping golf a component of the development a reality is the residential tower with 108 bespoke condominiums and penthouses. While more commonplace in some densely populated Asian countries, U.S. golf courses with a neighboring tower – whether residential, hotel or otherwise – is rare. “Building a tower was a no brainer,” said Witkoff. “It's very rare to have 150 acres in such a prime urban area within a major MSA. We’re able to build a tower and it makes sense to do it, more so than on a random Caribbean island or Montana or Wyoming. The opportunity to get this is unique.” In keeping golf as a core part of the Shell Bay project, a parcel of prime real estate was set aside  Residences are selling for between $2 million and $11 million, and while there’s a social membership to the club that comes with owning a home in the luxurious gated community, access to the golf course is separate. The course also won’t be an amenity for future guests of the boutique hotel when it’s completed. A golf club with a membership costing more than $1 million is not common, by any means. But either is a new high-end course (and community) that’s water accessible in a bustling metro area like Miami. And it appears the demand is there at Shell Bay. For land and for golf. “Golf is the background and canvas for the development,” said PPG’s Pearl. “The golf course is the backdrop but you’re also getting views of the ocean and the Intercoastal, with residences overlooking the marina and the tennis center. When you come through those gates, you’re in a real urban oasis.” With a new Greg Norman-designed championship course that aspires to host professional golf"

    "content": "The Rock returned to WWE, and fans are furious. The Rock came back on SmackDown (again) Friday night, and fans are furious. Sure, many fans in Birmingham, AL chanted his name, and were excited to see an unannounced appearance by The Rock. But as the dust settles and this storyline marinates, it’s leaving a very bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths. WWE posted Rock’s latest return on YouTube, and it’s a good thing YouTube disabled the dislike button, because fans are making full use of the toxic tool. The Rock is threatening to steal Cody Rhodes’ WrestleMania spot, and the comment section  “Felt so out of character when Cody left the ring. You win the rumble, almost beat Roman last year, wants the title for his father.. but gives it up to The Rock? Sad,” said one user to the tune of 23,000 likes. “71,000 likes, and 267,000 dislikes. If that doesn't tell you how the people feel about this bs [sic], then I don't know what else will,” read one comment. As of this writing, the   have swelled to 281,000. “Cody couldn't say he's more CM Punk without having the full Dwayne experience,” read one comment. “What was all that about, “Cody needs adversity?” What adversity has the Rock faced in the two years Cody’s been back? Hollywood championship indeed,” one user astutely pointed out. “The Rock taking advantage of his creative position to be the main event, sounds like Hulk Hogan.” Finally, one user wrote “Vince may have been gone, but his spirit lives on.” Terms like “Poor Cody,” “WE WANT CODY” and   are trending on Twitter. As I  , The Rock inserting himself in a WrestleMania main event as a Board Member is a bad look, and is certain to turn him heel. After years of Cody Rhodes vowing to finish his story, and fans with him every step of the way, Cody Rhodes willingly rented out his book to The Rock. Like a bleached-blonde book club. Whether WWE knows it or not, the expiration date for Cody to finish his story is WrestleMania 40. Not a second after. Now is not the time for Rhodes to get writer’s block because a   wants to headline WrestleMania. That’s just bad storytelling. Many are comparing Rhodes’ situation to the Daniel Bryan story. While there are similarities, this is worse. Much worse. In 2014, WWE didn’t have Daniel Bryan figured into its WrestleMania plans at all. Bryan wasn’t even included in the 2014 Royal Rumble, so the “Yes Movement” became an organic groundswell of support for Bryan, which ultimately became undeniable. In Rhodes’ case, WWE has trained its fans to believe that Cody is finishing his story. Even after Rhodes shockingly failed to defeat Reigns at WrestleMania 39, fans remained in support of the American Nightmare, knowing he’d finish his story at WrestleMania 40. With WWE now balking at the finish line, it is in danger of ruining one of its best modern-day storylines. The fallout could be disastrous, with fans likely to turn on Rhodes—not to mention Philadelphia turning on the WrestleMania 40 main event between  A   suggested WWE could be planning to unify the belts at SummerSlam, with presumed WWE world heavyweight champion Rhodes competing against whomever the WWE Undisputed Universal champion is coming out of WrestleMania. This is a terrible idea. Through Reigns’ scathing promo on SmackDown, WWE already defined the WWE World Heavyweight Championship as a second-place world title.   When Rollins was begging Rhodes to challenge him for the WWE World Championship on Raw, fans chanted “no!” As evidenced by CM Punk and Rollins himself, injuries can happen between now and SummerSlam. Most importantly, by then the bloom may be off the rose for Cody Rhodes’ story."

    "title": "Jusuf Nurkic Has Been A Welcome Fit With The Phoenix Suns’ Big 3",
    "content": "The Phoenix Suns acquired Jusuf Nurkic and Grayson Allen in a cost-effective trade that has worked  The Phoenix Suns followed one big splash with another when they committed about $475 million to Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal in recent trades, but their most cost-effective deal has largely slipped under the national radar. Not only did the Suns acquire starting center Jusuf Nurkic and starting wing Grayson Allen for center Deandre Ayton from Portland in the three-team trade that also sent Trail Blazers’ guard Damian Lillard to Milwaukee two days before the start of training camp, they  Nurkic and Allen were instrumental in helping the Suns play through the early-season injury absences of Durant, Devin Booker and Beal, who have started together in only 18 of the Suns’ first 46 games. Nurkic, a 7-footer, has provided the physical presence in the paint on both ends of the floor that the Suns were unable to coax out of Ayton in his five seasons in Phoenix. “‘Nurk’ has been wonderful,” Suns coach Frank Vogel said. “I couldn’t speak loudly enough about the role he has played. The guy is doing what is asked of him, without the need to get more shots or more touches or anything like that.” Nurkic has received  and 10.3 rebounds in 45 games and is on pace for his fifth career double-double season, but it more his rebounding/passing/court awareness that has made him a good fit. Ayton, the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, recently told reporters in Portland that he has “nothing to prove in this league. I’m a max player, and I’ll continue to be a max player,” he said, apparently equating salary with productivity. Suns' center Jusuf Nurkic bangs with Indiana Pacers' big man Jalen Smith. (AP Photo/Matt York) The Suns did not always see it that way. Ayton, also 7-0, averaged a double-double in Phoenix and showed a nice shooting touch from the foul line in, especially when he and Chris Paul perfected their two-man game. Yet Ayton was seldom a physical presence inside, often out-rebounded by shorter but more aggressive players such as Montrezl Harrell. On a team with 20-point scorers Durant, Beal and Booker, Ayton’s point production became superfluous this season. A different complementary component was required. Ayton was was benched in the playoffs two years ago for inattentiveness on defense, and his deficiencies also seemed to alienate teammates. That the Nurkic trade was a money-saver for owner Mat Ishiba only made it that much more valuable. The Suns took on about $93.7 million in salary in adding Nurkic, Allen, forward Nassir Little and guard Keon Johnson, but they were able to get out from under   max contract that runs through 2025-26. Nurkic has two years and $37 million remaining on his four-year deal. “High IQ,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said in evaluating Nurkic. “With the attention that those three (Durant, Booker, Beal) get, he’s a guy that is really good in the pocket. Over his time in his career he’s stretched his range to three-point range. And obviously, he’s a handful on the glass. He’s really good offensive rebounder.” Nurkic has contributed in multiple ways. He played a particularly physical game against Denver center and 2023 MVP Nikola Jokic on Dec.1, with 31 points and 11 rebounds. Nurkic and Jokic went body-to-body on three consecutive paint possessions in the third quarter and Nurkic scored on a pair of inside moves. The Nuggets won, 119-111, but the Suns noticed. “Just playing basketball,” Nurkic said. “Trying to use my strength, and trying to be who I am as big as I am.” Jusuf Nurkic has been an effective distributor in his first season in Phoenix. (Photo by Michael  Nurkic also flashed to the right spot when a Suns’ side inbounds play broke down in the final seconds of a 115-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 22. He took the inbounds pass when Durant was covered and deftly threw a quick bounce-pass back to Durant, who made a game-winning, double-clutch jump shot. “Probably a guy who doesn’t get enough credit for his passing,” Donovan said. “He plays in the middle of the floor and he has really good vision. He connects a lot on the second (weak) side and really generates shots for guys, because with Durant and Beal and Booker, when you send two on the ball and the ball gets into the pocket for him, he is really a very, very good playmaker from there.” Nurkic is not always on the floor late in games. The Suns have used small lineups when matchups dictate, such as in the 119-117 victory over Sacramento on Jan. 16 and a 118-105 victory over Miami last week. In those games, 6-11 Durant moved up to cover the opposing big, and the switch enables the Suns to put five shooters on the floor. The Suns have worked the matchup the other way, also. Nurkic had 28 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in 30 minutes in a 136-120 victory over the Brooklyn Nets last Wednesday, diving to the basket against over-matched Nic Clayton inside. Vogel, known as a defensive-mind coach, has been pleased with Nurkic’s play on that end. “He has really grown defensively from the standpoint of attacking everything that comes to our basket,” Vogel said. “Rim protection is as much as mindset as a talent, and I think he has really grown with that. “He’s had some opportunities in games where he hasn’t had opportunities to score or to facilitate, and some games he doesn’t touch the ball as much. He just goes out, feels the game out, and plays around the other guys. That type of unselfishness should not go unnoticed. We’re really pleased with what he’s brought to the table.” Jusuf Nurkic has provided a defensive presence in the paint. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)"

    "title": "Xavi: FC Barcelona Is ‘Paying For Caso Negreira’ After Alaves Win",
    "content": "Xavi Hernandez believes that FC Barcelona is being punished for the Caso Negreira scandal.  FC Barcelona head coach Xavi Hernandez said that FC Barcelona is \"paying\" for the Caso Negreira furore following a 3-1 win over Alaves on Saturday. The Blaugrana went 2-0 up thanks to goals from Robert Lewandowski and Ilkay Gundogan. Samu Omorodion pulled a consolation back two minutes after the German doubled the visitors' lead, but Vitor Roque then helped Barca retain a comfortable cushion that was enough to seal three points. Vitor Roque thankfully didn't become the villain of the night following his red card for a pair of yellows. Reacting to the bizarre sending off when it appeared as though the Brazilian didn't even touch a defender he was deemed to have fouled, Xavi  : \"It's another mistake by the referees against us. It's an injustice. You've all seen it.\" \"I'm just asking that they let us compete. I'm not going to talk about the referees anymore. Today is another glaring mistake. We are paying for the Negreira case. But I'm not going to talk about the referees. You can see the reality. I don't say it anymore or you'll kill me. Another mistake, again,\" he added. Barca was charged for continued corruption in the sports field last year for paying the former vice president of the Technical Referees Committee over $7.5 million from 2001 to 2018. The club denies wrongdoing and insists that the payments were made for honest consultation work, with the investigation continuing into 2024. Xavi praised his new striker Vitor Roque, who joined from Athletico Paranaense last month, for his eye for goal, the way he arrives in the box, and the depth he offers. There were also compliments for right winger Lamine Yamal, who played his part in Vitor Roque's second strike in two games. \"He's a beastly talent. [At just] 16 years old. Very few appear in these conditions. How he works, how he helps the full-back,\" Xavi said of the prodigy, who is already a starter and \"has no ceiling\". \"We've made a specific plan with him. He's a difference maker. We are looking at something special. I highlight how he competes, he doesn't get tired. \"He does many kilometers at high intensity. He comes back to defend. I am very happy. He's got defensive humility,\" Xavi beamed."

    "content": "Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings for 2023, propelled by a tsunami of demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs as new treatments emerge and compete for a slice of the growing market. Sales of Wegovy, an injectable prescription weight loss medicine, has helped boost profits for Novo  Novo Nordisk reported $33.7 billion of sales for 2023, an increase of 36% at constant exchange rates and beating analysts’ expectations. Full-year operating profit also exceeded analysts’ expectations, climbing 44% at constant exchange rates to $15 billion. Diluted earnings per share rose 52% to 18.61 Danish kroner ($2.7). Around 90% of the drugmaker's overall sales—$31.2 billion—came from its obesity and diabetes care division, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively authorized to treat diabetes and obesity. Sales of GLP-1 diabetes medications—a class that includes Ozempic—and in obesity care were largely responsible for this uptick, Novo Nordisk said, rising 52% and 154% at constant exchange rates, respectively. Novo Nordisk shares rose around 4% during early trading on Wednesday morning. \"We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. “Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.\" The stellar success of Ozempic and Wegovy—both branded drugs containing the same active ingredient, semaglutide—has rapidly propelled Novo Nordisk into a rarified club of extraordinarily valuable companies and triggered an acknowledged   for a company of its size. It now has a market value of around $480 billion, up from around $310 billion at the start of 2023, $250 billion at the start of 2022 and around $160 billion at the start of 2021. With such fast growth, Novo Nordisk recently dethroned French luxury goods firm LVMH as Europe’s most valuable public company and its market value is larger than the annual economic output of its home country, Denmark. Officials there are  over the country’s reliance on a single firm and   into the same trap as Finland when it hitched its wagon to erstwhile phone giant  . Semaglutide mimics the action of a hormone—GLP-1—that is responsible for regulating appetite and blood sugar. It has been shown to help facilitate weight loss and studies suggest it could bestow other health benefits in areas like heart and kidney disease as well. While it is far from the first drug shown to reduce weight, it does not appear to be accompanied by the same litany of often serious side effects as previous generations of weight loss drugs. Experts have therefore hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity, one of our era’s most pressing public health problems. For several years, Novo Nordisk has been the sole provider of GLP-1 generation of weight loss drugs and it has heavily struggled to meet booming demand. It was recently   by Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound injections—a branded name for tirzepatide, the same ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro—are also expected to become bestsellers. Analysts believe the anti-obesity market could become one of the most lucrative opportunities for the pharmaceutical sector in its history and could   be worth as much as $100 billion by the end of the decade and   much more. Adjacent industries like wellness,  , and fitness are reportedly   the popularity of weight loss drugs will eat into revenues. Novo Nordisk said it expects solid growth for the year ahead as well, with sales expected to climb as much as 26% and operating profit as much as 29% at constant exchange rates.  (FT)"

    "content": "School drop-off in modern times is a bit of a marvel. To a substantial degree, parents from the 20  century wouldn’t recognize it. Think about it. So many fathers leaving their kids at the front door, or inside the classroom. Better yet, so many   participating in drop-off together. This isn’t how it used to be, and readers know why. Or they should. In the days before 24-hour connectivity care of the Internet, work took place at a specific location. In my case, while I never saw my father on weekday mornings in the 1970s and 80s, my kids see me every weekday morning right up to school drop-off. And this in no way makes me unique. It was impossible not to think of modern parental realities while reading about the obnoxious grilling that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other prominent technology types suffered at the hands of grandstanding politicians (a redundancy, no doubt) the other day. Take Sen. Lindsey Graham. According to the ankle-biter from South Carolina, Zuckerberg and others “have blood” on their hands. It’s probably too late for the 68-year old in Graham, but he needs to grow up. What is the source of the angst manufactured by Graham and his fellow political alarmists (yet another redundancy) including Sens. Josh Hawley and Richard Durbin? They’re tying sexual exploitation, suicide, and all manner of other youthful societal maladies to the proliferation of “social media.” That’s right, before Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, and myriad other fruits of technological advance, young people were well-adjusted, healthy, and happy owing to life bereft of internet. Oh boy, weren’t the good old days great? Those of us who entered our teen years in the ‘80s, ‘90s and ‘00s surely never had friends who were sent into drug and alcohol rehab, never experienced sexual exploitation or heard about it (it turns out NBC’s   was just fiction!), never were exposed to or thought about suicide, and surely never had cross words with our parents. Ok, maybe the latter was true, but mainly because in the days before constant connectivity care of the internet and manifestations of same, more than a few of us rarely saw our parents as is. Seriously, what the parents of old would give for today’s problems! Kids spending lots of time on Facebook, Instagram and other popular social media sites. How very quaint considering the fears of old. In my day Angel Dust and cocaine kept parents up at night, as did television movies like   meant to terrify always-at-the-office parents about sexual predators who were seemingly not at the office when they were. But wait, social media and the endless stream of photos on Facebook and the rest body shame the youth of today on the way to bulimia and anorexia nervosa! Except that we had those fears too. Think 1981, and Jennifer Jason Leigh in  . Also, wasn’t recently collapsed   the annual whipping boy of old on the matter of body-shaming, bulimia, and countless other psychological problems of the body kind thanks to its swimsuit issue? Seemingly lost on the perpetually alarmed and offended is that teen angst has been around as long as teenagers have been, meaning  . From there, hopefully the reasonable among us can acknowledge that as opposed to being the problem for teens and young people, Facebook and others are the solution. Again, what parents of old would have given for the worries of today whereby interest in smartphones and the countless apps on same means that parents can not only regulate to varying degrees what their kids are seeing and doing, they also know   their kids are as they’re tapping away. This was a luxury parents of old didn’t have, among many others. Which brings us back to school drop-off. Thanks to the internet-authored connectivity that more and more enables remote work in concert with global marketing plans hatched on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok from homes masquerading as corporate headquarters, more and more parents are capable of closely looking after their kids at all hours as a way of protecting them from the endless threats that parents formerly couldn’t police from their actual offices. Yes, rather than attacking Mark Zuckerberg and colleagues, parents and hapless politicians should be thanking them."

CEO Jason Citron announced the platform will cut 17% of its workforce (roughly 170 employees) to “sharpen [its] focus and improve the way [it] work[s] together to bring more agility” to the company,   reported. Video game software developer   announced in a   it will cut one-quarter of its staff (roughly 1,800 jobs) as part of a restructuring plan to “position itself for long-term and profitable growth.” Layoffs in January hit a  , with more than 82,300 employees losing their jobs at U.S. companies, according to a report released Thursday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. With a group of tech giants and startups, as well as banks and financial service companies all conducting job cuts, the month of January saw the second-most layoffs in any month since January 2009 (nearly 103,000 people lost their jobs in January 2023). . That’s how many employees lost their jobs in major U.S. layoffs last year, according to Forbes’ layoff tracker, which included layoffs affecting 100 or more jobs. The biggest of those cuts came in July, when now-bankrupt trucking company Yellow laid off all 30,000 of its employees. Preceding Yellow Corporation were a pack of tech and manufacturing companies announcing layoffs, including  , which announced plans in January 2023 to cut 8,000 employees amid an “uncertain economy,” and laid off another 9,000 workers in November, after cutting 10,000 jobs in late 2022. Google parent   cut another 12,000 employees in January 2023 due to what CEO Sundar Pichai called “tough choices,” while   and Microsoft each laid off 10,000 positions that same month (Meta cut another 6,000 employees two months later). Banking giant Citigroup announced earlier this month it will cut 20,000 employees over the next two years, according to a statement from CFO Mark Mason, following a $1.8 billion fourth quarter   the bank’s worst quarter in 15 years. Citigroup’s cuts follow a   at major U.S. banks, following investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, which cut 4,000 employees last year, and JPMorgan Chase, which let go of 1,000 employees in May.

An Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 plane sits at a gate at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in  A Portland schoolteacher has found the missing door plug from the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet forced to make an   after a dramatic in-flight blowout last Friday, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a press conference late on Sunday. The teacher, identified only as Bob, found the missing fuselage in his yard and contacted the agency with pictures. “Thank you, Bob,” Homendy said, adding that investigators are “really pleased” with the finding. Homendy said investigators are going to go and pick up the component and “make sure that we begin analyzing it.” A  , which   has a window and weighs around 27kg (60lb), is used to seal an emergency exit that is not used by the airline. Investigators hope analyzing the piece will give an insight into what happened when the plug detached from the aircraft over Oregon, blowing a refrigerator-sized hole in the side of the plane. Investigators have been searching for the missing door plug—  as a “key missing component”—since the  of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 in Portland shortly after takeoff on Friday. The flight, which was carrying 177 passengers and crew, suffered an accident that prompted panic as oxygen masks descended and the cabin depressurized,   with such force that headrests and cushions were ripped from seats. No one was hurt in the incident, thanks to passengers wearing seat belts for takeoff, the plane having not yet reached cruising altitude—which would have been much higher and would’ve led to a more forceful depressurization—and nobody sitting in the seats immediately next to the plug that blew off. The incident follows a   of   for Boeing and its 737 Max jet and the company has faced heavy   for its conduct. Its entire fleet was previously grounded for more than a year for safety checks after the loss of two aircraft in fatal crashes and numerous other faults and quality   have been found since, including calls for airlines to check the rudder for a missing bolt in December. U.S. regulators have now   the craft pending further safety inspections. The vast majority of Boeing 737 Max 9s are   by U.S. airlines, mostly United Airlines and Alaska. They are also used by Turkish Airlines, Panama’s Copa Airlines and Aeromexico, who have all reportedly grounded jets for inspections. The directive has sparked cancellations in the U.S. affecting tens of thousands of people. \"Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,” Boeing said in a statement in response to the latest grounding,   to CNN. “We agree with and fully support the FAA’s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.\" 171. That’s how   Boeing 737 Max jets the Federal Aviation Administration has   pending safety inspections, r , 215,000 are configured to use the plug.

    "content": "The Ukrainian 4th Tank Brigade in 2023. Five hundred tanks. More than 600 fighting vehicles. Hundreds of howitzers. Forty thousand troops. According to Ukraine’s eastern command, Russia has assembled a huge field army in eastern Ukraine opposite the free Ukrainian city of Kupyansk. It’s obvious what this army aims to do: retake a huge swathe of Kharkiv Oblast that the Russians briefly occupied in 2022—until a powerful Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the oblast late that year. Everything east of the nearest major river is the goal. “The Russian Federation plans to seize the entire Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and part of Kharkiv Oblast up to the Oskil River by March 2024,” the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies  . The river threads through Kupyansk from the north. Why March? Because that’s when Russia will “vote” for “president” in a national “election.” In fact, Vladimir Putin is the only real candidate—and will maintain his brutal, dictatorial control over Russia  the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. A slice of Kharkiv would be an election-day gift to Putin from the Russian army in Ukraine. Some or part of around 10 Ukrainian brigades, anchored in the north by the 3rd Tank Brigade and south by the 4th Tank Brigade, defends Kupyansk and surrounding settlements. It’s a significant forces with perhaps 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks, fighting vehicles and howitzers. But people and vehicles aren’t the problem for the Ukrainians. The problem is  . The United States was one of the biggest donors of 155-millimeter shells for Ukraine’s best big guns—and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress cut off aid to Ukraine last fall. Since then, Ukrainian forces’ daily allotment of shells has fallen by two-thirds to just 2,000 rounds. Russian forces meanwhile fire as many as 10,000 shells a day, thanks to a steady supply of ammo from North Korea. Russia’s new firepower advantage allows it to concentrate artillery without much fear of Ukrainian counterbattery fire— . “This situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach: the systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible,” Ukrainian analysis team Frontelligence Insight  . The demolition already has begun. “Our satellite imagery reveals sustained and intense artillery damage” around Kupyansk, Frontelligence Insight reported. “Artillery shortages and delays in Western security assistance will create uncertainty in Ukrainian operational plans,” the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C.  , “and likely prompt Ukrainian forces to husband materiel, which may force Ukrainian forces to make tough decisions about prioritizing certain sectors of the front over sectors where limited territorial setbacks are least damaging.” It’s not clear whether Kyiv is willing to trade away any of Kharkiv Oblast. With a pre-war population of 1.4 million, Kharkiv is Ukraine’s third city—and hosts strategic war industries including Ukraine’s main tank plant. So the Kupyansk garrison must hold. Anticipating the coming offensive, the Ukrainian defense ministry has organized new mechanized brigades and deployed them to Kupyansk to reinforce the garrison.  Perhaps most importantly, Ukrainian workshops are building explosives-laden first-person-view drones—tens of thousands of them per month. As artillery ammunition becomes scarce, Ukrainian brigades are flinging more and more FPVs at the Russians: sometimes thousands per day all along the 600-mile front. But the FPVs range just two miles or so—too short to target artillery that might be 15 or miles from the line of contact. Drone-operators have made quick work of small Russian assault groups that, for months now, have been probing the Kupyansk sector. But can a swarm of two-pound drones, even thousands of them, defeat 500 tanks and 650 fighting vehicles as they attack behind a wall of artillery fire? We may find out."

In a Friday  with the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice alleged that Border Patrol agents had been denied access to the area, which includes a boat ramp that agents typically use to conduct operations along the Rio Grande, with gates and “armed personnel” blocking normal access points. The Department of Justice is asking the court to intervene, noting that the state’s actions since the government filing “demonstrate an escalation of the state’s measures to block” Border Patrol duties. In a   on X, formerly Twitter, Abbott reposted a video of Shelby Park, writing that “as caravans of migrants are moving through Mexico toward the border, we are making clear that Texas will be a tough place to cross.” In its Friday filing, the Department of Justice cites a Dec. 19   from a U.S. Appeals Court that bars Border Patrol agents from destroying state-erected fencing—a decision that the Justice Department is currently appealing—from contributing to the lack of access to the area. The Justice Department has also  Texas over a controversial immigration law that gives state officials the authority to arrest migrants crossing the border illegally—enforcement that’s typically reserved for the federal government. As the number of migrants crossing the border continues to surge, Abbott and other Texas Republicans have criticized the Biden Administration’s response. Eagle Pass has been the focus of these debates in recent months,  to the Texas Tribune, which notes that in June, Salinas agreed to allow the state to declare Shelby Park private property so that state officials could arrest migrants for trespassing. But resident complaints prompted Salinas to support rescinding that decision. There have been conflicting messages on the impact of the seizure on Border Patrol operations. The Border Patrol Union—which has   the Biden Administration’s response to the border—  that the state’s actions would enhance Border Patrol operations by taking agents away from an area where many migrants “are simply surrendering” and allowing them to patrol areas with higher numbers of migrants “who attempt to escape arrest.” But in the Department of Justice court filing, Border Patrol Lead Field Coordinator Robert Danley testified that Border Patrol uses the now fenced-off area as a “pre-staging area” for migrant encounters, where Border Patrol engages in mobile intake of migrants and treats emergent medical or welfare needs.

The Coach had been engaged in a   with the Nerazzurri, but in his pre-match press conference opted to praise his rivals. “We have great respect for Inter,” Allegri told reporters on Saturday. “They are the strongest side and the favorites for the Scudetto. External talk doesn't interest us, we have to think about what we can do. Football has many unexpected events and you have to keep your feet on the ground.” “Playing a match like this, just one point behind Inter, is a reward for these wonderful guys. Having said that, anything can happen tomorrow, as always in these type of games.\" Inter have a game in hand over Juve in addition to their one point advantage in the table, and Allegri was asked to name one player he admired from the opposition. FLORENCE, ITALY - JANUARY 28:  Marcus Thuram of FC Internazionale warms up ahead the Serie A TIM  “An Inter player that I've been impressed by? I'd say [Marcus] Thuram,” Allegri responded before once again opting to play down any talk of a title win. “When you play there is always something to lose. Our strength is working on our limits, and we are very committed to this. We are a cohesive group, with the desire to do important things: in the meantime, we need at least 20 points to reach the Champions League.\" \"It will be a wonderful evening of sport, in front of a sold-out stadium. We know Inter's strength, but we are very good as well: it is a step on our journey, we have many more points to earn to reach our goal.\" \"It won't be a decisive turning point for the championship, because two draws are not enough to change everything.

    "title": "Sixers' Joel Embiid Could Help Teammate Tyrese Maxey Earn An Extra $41 Million",
    "content": "PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - NOVEMBER 08: Joel Embiid #21 and Tyrese Maxey #0 of the Philadelphia  Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, the NBA's reigning Most Valuable Player, missed his 13th game of the season on Thursday with a meniscus injury that will sideline him at least through the weekend. ESPN's   reported that \"there is still uncertainty over how Embiid and the 76ers will move forward with a treatment plan for the injury, and options will be discussed over the next several days.\" Either way, Embiid seems unlikely to return anytime soon. That's terrible news for the Sixers, but it could help teammate Tyrese Maxey earn a financial windfall this summer. The NBA's new CBA requires players to play in at least 65 games to become eligible for MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player, the All-NBA teams and the All-Defensive teams. Players must play at least 20 minutes per game in all but two of those games, and they have to play between 15-20 minutes in the other two. Embiid, who was both the league's MVP and the first-team All-NBA center last season, is all but certain to fall short of that 65-game threshold this year. He isn't the only All-NBA member from last season in danger of missing out, either. Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler, a second-team selection last year, has already missed 15 games this season. That means he can miss only two more before he becomes ineligible. New York Knicks forward Julius Randle, a third-team selection last year and an All-Star reserve this season, has missed the Knicks' past three games with a dislocated shoulder that seems likely to sideline him at least through the All-Star break. Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton didn't make an All-NBA team last season, but he was voted in as an All-Star starter this year. However, Haliburton has already missed 13 games this season and left 13 minutes into the Jan. 8 game against the Boston Celtics where he suffered the hamstring injury that plagued him for the rest of the month. According to   of Fieldhouse Files, the in-season tournament title game does count toward Haliburton's number of games played. That means he can miss four more before becoming ineligible for All-NBA. Since his return, he's barely cracking 20 minutes per game, which suggests he and the Pacers have the 65-game minimum in mind. With Embiid, Haliburton, Butler and Randle all in danger of becoming ineligible for All-NBA and the other major awards, that could open more spots for other players. Maxey, who was named an All-Star for the first time on Thursday, might be uniquely poised to benefit. In Embiid's absence Thursday against the Utah Jazz, Maxey scored a career-high 51 points on 17-of-27 shooting. He became the   in the past 45-plus years to record 50-plus points in zero turnovers in a game, trailing only Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. The Sixers might not need  level of production out of him every night, but he needs to be their offensive engine until Embiid returns. Maxey is already averaging a career-high 26.3 points and 6.4 assists per game, albeit in a league-leading 37.5 minutes per night. If he has an uptick in production sans Embiid and keeps the Sixers afloat in the playoff race, voters might look favorably upon his All-NBA case at the end of the season. The All-NBA teams used to be divided by position—two guards, two forwards and one center on each of the three teams—but the new CBA made them positionless. That could help Maxey if there are more than six guards deserving of All-NBA honors, but it could work against him if more forwards and bigs have better cases than some of the guards. The Sixers   on signing Maxey to an extension this past offseason to keep his cheap $13.0 million cap hold on their books for this summer. Leading up to the trade deadline, they have the ability to create   in cap space this summer by renouncing all of their free agents, including Tobias Harris, De'Anthony Melton and Nicolas Batum. But that flexibility could prove costly when it comes to Maxey. If Maxey makes an All-NBA team, he'll become eligible for a max contract that begins at 30 percent of the salary cap instead of 25 percent. Based on the  , the 30 percent max would start at $42.3 million and be worth $245.3 million over five years, while a 25 percent max would start at $35.25 million and be worth $204.5 million. From a team perspective, it would benefit the Sixers if Maxey falls short of an All-NBA team. It won't affect their offseason plans either way—they'll re-sign him after making their other moves if they dip below the salary cap—but that $7 million-per-year difference could limit their flexibility in future years. There's nothing they can do about that now, though. They need to lean on Maxey until Embiid returns, which means his production is likely to spike. The Sixers' final place in the standings could help determine whether Maxey makes an All-NBA team or not. If he does, he’ll likely have an extra $41 million headed his way this offseason, in part thanks to Embiid."

    "title": "Since The Brewers Traded Corbin Burnes, The NL Central Is Up For Grabs",
    "content": "Cincinnati Reds' Elly De La Cruz steals home with Milwaukee Brewers catcher William Contreras  The National League Central is one of the most turbulent divisions in MLB. It always seems to have three or four clubs who are above average without ever having one of the best in the league, leading to frenetic Septembers with constantly shifting standings. Also, there are the Pittsburgh Pirates. 2023 was even more chaotic than usual as the Milwaukee Brewers eventually pulled away with 92 wins, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds both surprised the league by finishing above .500, and the St. Louis Cardinals landed in last place for the first time since 1990. The Brewers were favored to repeat as division champs for the first time since 1981-1982... until they   in a shocking move two days ago, then announced they’re “ .” Now the division is wide open, but there are still an unusually high number of impact free agents available. Each of the five franchises has a path to the NL Central crown if they act quickly to fill their needs. The youth movement is here in Milwaukee, for better or worse.   this offseason before he ever played a game in MLB. He’ll be joined in the starting lineup by William Contreras, Sal Frelick, Garrett Mitchell, Joey Ortiz, and Brice Turang, all of whom have yet to reach their arbitration-eligible years. Christian Yelich is still kicking around and they signed Rhys Hoskins to man first base. Willy Adames, the dependable, power-hitting shortstop, appears to be the odd man out. He has one year remaining before free agency. If the club can get MLB-ready starting pitching in a trade for him, they have to listen. With Burnes gone, the rotation gets sparse after Freddy Peralta. Alternatively, they could even consider moving Jeferson Quero for pitching. He’s one of the game’s best catching prospects, but he won’t help the club immediately and is blocked by Contreras anyway. The big question of the Cubs’ offseason is whether or not they’ll re-sign Cody Bellinger. The best position player in this year’s free-agent class remains on the market, but the team could be content to move on. Future Gold Glover Pete Crow-Armstrong is ready to take over in center field, Ian Happ and Seiya Suzuki will man the corners, recent acquisition Michael Busch will play first base, and Christopher Morel is the primary designated hitter. If they do bring Bellinger back, they’d have to make a corresponding trade just to make the pieces fit. If they’re going to give out another long-term contract in the ballpark of $30 million per season, they might be better off signing a pitcher instead. Left-handers Blake Snell and Jordan Montgomery are still unsigned. They brought in Japanese free agent Shota Imanaga to fill Marcus Stroman’s void, but aging starters Kyle Hendricks and Jameson Taillon are less than reliable, and Imanaga himself is still unproven. Signing one of the best starters available when Milwaukee expelled their ace could shift the balance of power in the division. Many people thought the Reds would deal away their glut of infielders to clear playing time for their youngsters and supplement other needs this winter. Instead, they signed corner infielder Jeimer Candelario to a three-year, $36 million contract, exacerbating the logjam. Elly De La Cruz, Christian Encarnacion-Strand, Noelvi Marte, and Matt McLain all debuted in 2023 and deserve regular at bats. Jonathan India remains on the roster against all odds, but is a prime candidate to be traded. On the pitching side, the team signed Nick Martinez and Frankie Montas to join homegrown starters Andrew Abbott, Graham Ashcraft, and Hunter Greene. The bullpen is a greater concern, even after acquiring free agents Emilio Pagán and Brent Suter. With the relief pitching market thinned out in free agency, they could see if they can move India or Encarnacion-Strand for reliable relievers. The Pirates won 76 games last year and finished in fourth place. That constitutes a relative success for one of MLB’s most moribund franchises. Would they be better off if they sprung for Snell or Bellinger? Of course, but owner Bob Nutting is more likely to sell you one of the city’s lovely bridges. Their best bet for success is hoping that young post-prospects like Oneil Cruz and Henry Davis take leaps forward. Their 2024 season—and their hopes for the future—rest on the right arm of Paul Skenes, the consensus top pitching prospect in MLB. He was the first overall pick in the 2023 draft after dominating college baseball at LSU. He arguably possesses the best fastball   the best slider in the minors and commands both of them well. He doesn’t have anything left to prove at the minor-league level, so it’s just a question of when the Pirates want to start his service clock. The Cardinals are learning the difference between “multipositional” and “positionless.” Brendan Donovan and Tommy Edman represent the former, but neither is a complete player offensively. Nolan Gorman and Jordan Walker are the latter. Even though both have enormous power potential, they need to take major steps forward with their glovework to avoid dragging the team down. On the other side of that coin is shortstop Masyn Winn, a potentially elite defender who still needs to prove he can hit MLB pitching. Despite all of the question marks in the lineup, their pitching was the main reason they lost 91 games. They attempted to shore up their rotation early in the offseason by signing Cy Young runner-up Sonny Gray and veteran inning-eaters Kyle Gibson and Lance Lynn, but at 34, 36, and 36, those moves could easily backfire.   and they should inquire about a reunion with Montgomery."

    "content": "Cody Rhodes will come face-to-face with Roman Reigns on SmackDown. Tonight’s broadcast of a sold-out SmackDown in Birmingham, AL featured Roman Reigns coming face-to-face with Cody Rhodes for the first time since Rhodes won his second Royal Rumble match. While Seth Rollins made a compelling case for Rhodes to challenge him at WrestleMania, Rhodes is fully expected to finish his story by challenging Reigns. Hours before SmackDown aired, there were also reports that   were backstage in Alabama. SmackDown also featured an appearance from Logan Paul, and women’s Royal Rumble winner Bayley declaring whom her WrestleMania 40 opponent will be and Last week’s broadcast of SmackDown garnered a viewership of 2.475 million. Logan Paul started off by saying they don’t want him here and he doesn’t want to be there either. Paul said Kevin Owens did more damage to Paul than Floyd Mayweather because Owens made him bleed. Getting the “what” treatment, Logan Paul mocked all the injured Superstars—CM Punk, Seth Rollins, etc.—while calling himself “unbreakable,” despite the fact that he did get  Logan Paul appeared on commentary, and Corey Graves seemed pretty awkward in the play-by-play role. Graves was hamstrung having to play the neutral party and not being able to cape for Logan Paul. He’s talented enough to eventually ease into this role, but it’s tough sledding early on. Austin Theory gets better every week. This week, Kevin Owens learned his lesson and used brass knuckles, but obscured them from the referee’s vision to ensure the victory. Prior to this Fatal 4-Way tag team match was a vignette showing Santos Escobar leading a toast to “eradicate” LWO. Joaquim Wilde asked the field “you wanna go viral?” before a handful of competitors launched him into the rest of the tag team. It was very impressive, but whether or not it will go viral remains to be seen. Wilde and Del Toro took everybody out, with help from Zelina Vega, who the turned her attention to Elektra Lopez with a Meteora. Pete Dunne and Tyler Bate won this match, meaning they advanced to the finals and will face the winners of the WWE Raw Fatal 4-Way tag team match. WWE rushed Bayley’s face-turn and feud with Iyo Sky as Damage CTRL were talking trash about Bayley backstage. Unfortunately for them, Bayley could overhear her. Wade Barrett lost a lot of credibility by saying he couldn’t wait to see whom Bayley was going to challenge, which came after Bayley overheard Iyo bashing Bayley backstage. Bayley began speaking Japanese to Damage CTRL, saying she could understand what they said behind her back. Bayley then challenged Iyo Sky in a great, if not rushed, moment. The Kabuki Warriors and Iyo then attacked Bayley as fans booed profusely. Bayley grabbed a pipe from under the ring and cleaned house. She then challenged Iyo Sky to a WrestleMania match as the crowd popped. Prior to this match was a brawl between Bobby Lashley and the Street Profits and the Final Testament. Team Lashley was saved by the returning B-Fab. This seems a way too early for Tiffany Stratton to compete on the main roster, but as a highly athletic gymnast, Stratton should eventually swim just fine after being thrown in the deep end. This was advertised as the SmackDown main event at 6:20, which means The Rock will probably cut his garden-variety half-hour promo. This wasn’t that bad of a debut for Stratton by any means. Roman Reigns eviscerated Seth Rollins. He started out by mentioning Rollins’ name, then saying “exactly, no pop!” He called Seth his “little brother.” He said Rollins can’t call himself the man running around in his wife’s clothes. He said Rollins broke his back three months into trying to carry WWE Raw. Then he began liming and asked Alabama if a workhorse “walks like this?” Reigns seemed legitimately annoyed by all the talk of him being a part-timer, saying he works 10-times less than Rollins but makes 10-times more money. This may have been the greatest promo of Reigns’ career. Crazy. Fans chanted “Cody!” as soon as Rhodes’ music cut off. Rhodes said he’s coming for Roman Reigns’ title, but not at WrestleMania. This prompted The Rock to return. The Rock faced off with Roman Reigns as SmackDown went off the air."

    "title": "Can Sharapova Dominate In 'Exciting' Pickleball Debut?",
    "content": "Tennis legend Maria Sharapova poses for the media as she is unveiled as car manufacturer Porsche's  Tennis legend Maria Sharapova says that it doesn’t matter what sport she's playing. There is something about her that’s a constant: “Once a competitor, always a competitor.” The longtime world No. 1 and winner of all four singles Grand Slam events has taken up a new pastime, pickleball. Now that pickleball has captivated sports lovers all over the world, it has created interest not just in the growing Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) but has also drawn in many of the world's most beloved tennis stars. Sharapova is part of the highly-touted Pickleball Slam tournament, where she will join fellow tennis legends John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, and Steffi Graf this Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, for the event called Pickleball Slam 2. Sharapova, who has thus far been waiting her turn to compete on the biggest of stages, hints that pickleball is not “just for fun” but brings out the top athlete in everyone, especially Hall of Fame-level tennis stars. “I think all the legends on the court come from very competitive backgrounds, and there will be no holding back, which will make it so much more exciting and fun,” Sharapova said during our interview Friday. “Every time I play, it's been really fun to see how much I giggle, but also how frustrated I can get during some of the games.” Sharapova adds that while playing and even practicing pickleball, her game will often“span a variety of emotions.” This weekend, tennis diehards will get to see the duo of Sharapova and McEnroe take on husband and wife team Agassi and Graf, who will compete for a $1 million purse. Pickleball Slam 2, created and produced by Horizon Sports & Experiences (HS&E) and InsideOut Sports & Entertainment (ISE), will be broadcast live during primetime on ESPN at 8:30 PM from Hard Rock Live at Seminole at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida. During the inaugural Pickleball Slam event in April 2023, fans saw Agassi team up with Andy Roddick to beat McEnroe and Michael Chang and win the first $1 million purse, which was the largest tournament purse in pickleball history. Still, to Sharapova, who logged a 645–171 singles record over her 19-year career, playing pickleball is still relatively “new territory,” she said. “The main reason I wanted to participate in this event was to play against Steffi Graf, who I admired for so many years,” Sharapova explains. Graf, who retired from pro tennis in 1999, was the last tennis player to win the “Calendar Slam” in 1988 when she won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open within the same year. It wasn’t until 2004, the same year Graf was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, that Sharapova burst onto the scene at age 17 by winning Wimbledon, beating Serena Williams in two straight sets. “It’ll be great to compete against (Graf) and Andre with John—all of us playing this sport that’s having such a moment,” Sharapova said. “I’ve been practicing a bunch, so we’ll see. But I think John and I are going to be a formidable team.” Andre Agassi and Sharapova pose prior to a show match during the WTA Tennis tournament at the  David Levy, HS&E’s co-CEO/founder, said that he thinks this weekend’s Pickleball Slam 2 “is the ultimate showcase for the fastest-growing sport in the world.” “As we bring together four former world No. 1 tennis players to play for a $1M purse in primetime on ESPN, widespread fan interest in this year’s event is driving significant brand engagement.” Levy adds that big-time sponsors have been beating down the door, and in addition to Hard Rock, Slam 2’s host, State Farm, Brighthouse Financial, Franklin Sports, E*Trade, and AstraZeneca/Calquence have all jumped in to participate in sponsoring pickleball, one of the world’s fastest-growing sports. As an added authentic element this year, Levy said that “Florida residents can place bets on the Slam 2 via Hard Rock Bet.” But what about Sharapova’s legendary swing? I asked her whether her world-class tennis skills and big court movement work to her advantage in a small racket/paddle sport such as pickleball. “I was initially quite surprised by how different everything felt about pickleball. I thought there would be more similarities,” Sharapova said. “But I guess there's no such thing as ‘enough’ power.” Yet, along with her competitive mindset, Sharapova said that she thinks, come Sunday, she will “definitely use a lot of that strength that I had in my tennis career. But there’s a new skill set around hitting the short balls in the kitchen,”—or the non-volley zone, right in front of the net. “All these new terms that I'm becoming familiar with have been a very entertaining journey,” she added. “But overall, yeah, I think there are a few elements of tennis that you can bring in, but I'd say I was surprised at how different it felt.” Besides being a fresh new challenge for elite athletes and weekend warriors alike, Sharapova also thinks that pickleball has a bright future as a sport. “On the business side, it’s definitely growing, and how could it not? The engagement across the country is extremely high. You can see why people are really having fun with it.” Sharapova notes the growth of the game within tennis and recreation clubs all over America, “engaging with it and building pickle courts on their properties.” She admits that there are natural challenges to advancing any sport, but “by having more of it on TV and accessible to people,” she said, “it grows the game.” Of course, I had to ask the tennis phenom about her first love, tennis and the current crop of WTA stars making their mark. The two players that have stood out the most to Sharapova are world No. 3 Coco Gauff, who won last year’s US Open, and up-and-comer Mirra Andrea, the current WTA no. 35 player. “I've loved watching a new generation rise up to the occasion,” Sharapova. “I was so impressed with how Coco handled the victory in New York last year. Also, it’s great seeing the rise of new names and opportunities for athletes like Mirra Andreeva. Sharapova adds, “We’re seeing so much more consistency in the women's game and that has been really refreshing.” *****"

PayPal headquarters on Feb. 2, 2022 in San Jose, California.  A total of 82,307 people were laid off from U.S.-based employers last month, the report says, with companies citing restructuring, closing, market conditions and cost-cutting as the largest reasons for dramatic staffing changes. With the exception of January 2023, when 102,943 job cuts were announced, last month saw the highest number of layoffs since January 2009, when 241,749 people lost their jobs. Financial companies announced the most cuts in January (23,238), followed by the technology sector (15,806), food production industry (6,656) and retail sector (5,364). Hirings. U.S. employers announced plans to hire 5,376 workers in January, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, down significantly from January 2023, when companies had plans to hire 32,764 people. 224,000. That’s how many Americans applied for unemployment at the end of January, according to  , a nearly three-month high. There were 199,000 unemployment claims in the last week of January 2023, but this year's number is lower than the same time in 2022 ( ) and 2021 ( ). Despite the layoffs, the unemployment rate remains low—well below levels at the start of the pandemic in 2020 or the financial crisis 15 years ago. Unemployment was 3.7% in December,   the latest jobs report, the same as November and below estimates of 3.8%. The federal government will release January’s unemployment data on Friday. The Federal Reserve is projecting the unemployment rate will hit a mean 4.1% by the end of 2024, which would make it the first time unemployment broke 4% since February 2018. The Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates to decades-long highs last year—part of a bid to get inflation under control—has contributed to a general slowdown in economic conditions. High interest rates typically correlate with an uptick in the unemployment rate, but unemployment remains well within the historic range and economic experts predict an expected decline in rates will allow the labor market to remain fairly strong despite the spate of layoffs across sectors. When Fed officials will decide to lower benchmark interest rates is still unclear, but a   of pay and benefits for American workers could pressure the agency to make changes sooner rather than later.

    "title": "Forget The New MacBook Pro, Apple’s Jony Ive Had Something Much Better",
    "content": "Apple’s MacBook line-up is a sprawling mix of Air and Pros, M3s and M2 Maxs, various screen sizes and multiple designs. It’s far from the clean and simple lines the Apple brand promises. Yet there was another way of laying out the various MacBook laptops that would have delivered just that. Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (Photographer: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg) Speaking with   (via  ), long-time tech reporter Walt Mossberg talked about then Apple Design Chief Jony Ive wanting to unify the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines into a single behemoth “MacBook” offering, reasoning that the MacBook Pro could be engineered to be just as thin and portable as the MacBook Air. As we know, that didn’t happen, but the next MacBook Air at this time saw minimal changes, but enough to mark it out as a new product. Apple’s Intel-powered MacBook line-up remained crowded and confused. It’s a problem that Apple magnified when the launch of Apple Silicon paired the consumer-focused M1 chipset into both a MacBook Air case and a MacBook Pro case. The former was clearly a great pairing, but the latter was little more than the MacBook Air with a fan to help cooling; the true MacBook Pro models would arrive six months later with a new design, a choice of 14-inch and 16-inch displays, and the professionally focused M1 Pro and M1 Max Apple Silicon chipset. The M1 MacBook Pro was stranded.. too expensive compared to the MacBook Air and too underpowered compared to the other MacBook Pro laptops. There was a thin argument that you wanted both the Air and Pro brands on show in the move to Apple Silicon, but Apple continued with its Frankenstein MacBook Pro in both the M2 and M3 generations. This brings me back to Ive’s focus on a smaller portfolio offering value at each segment, following the Apple tradition of a good/better/best offering for the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac, and the MacBook. If Ive were to have his way and merge the Air and the Pro into a singular MacBook category, how would the Apple Silicon family have looked? You’d have the entry-level model that delivers for the consumers—which would more than likely be the MacBook with M3, the mid-tier MacBook with M3 Pro, and a top-tier MacBook with M3 Max. Throw in the choice of a 14-inch or 16-inch display, and you have a simplified range which everyone understands and is confident they have the best model for their needs. Instead, Apple has a confusing mess of Airs and Pros, with different markets targeted by similar machines, mismatched steps in both performance and design and a portfolio that feels designed to upsell you to the next model."

    "title": "Serious Warning Issued for 2 Billion Google Chrome Users",
    "content": "If you’re one of the billion-plus users of Google Chrome on Windows, then you should note the serious new warning issued this week. The surprise is that this warning—on Chrome’s behalf—comes from one of its harshest, most vocal critics. Serious new Google Chome warning for all Microsoft Windows users Google Chrome   the worldwide browser market, with approaching 65% of the market to Apple Safari’s less than 20% in second place. Every other alternative, including Microsoft Edge, is just an also-ran. Microsoft isn’t used to any kind of also-ran status, and in a world where its Windows operating system has an even more   desktop market share, a new report suggests it is doing something about this. If you use Chrome on a Windows device, the report warns that your user experience will be badly hit. The research was sponsored by Mozilla, developer of the Firefox browser which lags a little behind Edge, with a 3.3% versus 5.3% market share. Mozilla   “two independent experts… to investigate Microsoft’s design practices across its core OS (Windows 10 and 11), web browser (Edge), and search engine (Bing).” “We find,”  , “Microsoft repeatedly using harmful design to influence users into using Edge.” Claims include “harmful preselection, visual interference, trick wording, and disguised ads patterns to skew user choice of which browser to install… Obstruction to dissuade the switch [to a different default browser] and a refusal to switch the corresponding default app for various local web-related filetypes… [and ongoing] “harmful patterns to push the user back towards Edge.” Mozilla is no fan of Chrome, to say the least. “Chrome is the only major browser that does not offer meaningful protection against cross-site tracking,” it has said of the long-delayed removal of tracking cookies from Chrome. And its website warns that Chrome’s “privacy record is questionable… Google actually collects a disturbingly large amount of data from its users—Google runs the world’s largest advertising network, thanks in large part to data they harvest from their users.” But the report that Mozilla has just published is not really about Edge competing for users with Firefox. It is all about Chrome. Because, in reality, most Windows users by the numbers will install Chrome. And so it serves as a warning to those users. With a fresh Windows desktop, users find Edge pre-installed and set as the default. It is also pinned to the taskbar and can’t be uninstalled. If the user decides to install Chrome, the report shows how Microsoft interrupts the install, claiming security and privacy benefits of Edge. The researchers warn that “users may be alarmed when they see the Edge promotional message appear within the Chrome download page, reasoning that since the banner is unusual it must be very important.” Edge promotion features prominently Such interruptions occur whichever browser is being installed. But “if the user is looking to download Google Chrome,” the report says, “Microsoft takes an even more aggressive approach, intervening twice more in the user journey.” Edge popup during Chrome install Edge promotion after searching to download Chrome Edge ad injected into Chrome install page itself There are other obstructive examples cited in the report, including a survey mid Chrome install, which points again to the benefits of Edge. “We deem this survey and its subsequent page an example of Obstruction,” the report says, “that makes it harder for users to complete Chrome installation.” In parallel, as seen below, the import of Google data into Edge seems to be presented as a standard setup dialog. User preferences are not highlighted. It’s very easy for a user to click the Apply button with the default settings as shown. Users asked to import Google data into Edge This behavior, the researchers say, begins as soon as a user starts to search for browsers. The report includes multiple examples of ads injected into the search and install process, all of which seem to disrupt the user’s choice based on “inside” knowledge of what they intend to install. The report isn't limited to browsers, it also looks at search and cites examples where users are encouraged to shift from Google’s search to Microsoft Bing’s within an alternative browser, such as Chrome—assuming that install was not deterred. Bing Vs Chrome search setting prompt The report acknowledges that “Edge is a relatively minor player. Since Windows is still the dominant OS, it is clear that millions of Windows users have overcome the practices we’ve questioned to successfully download and use Chrome. Microsoft may therefore argue these practices don’t unfairly skew the browser market or user choice.” Google Chrome versus Microsoft Edge doesn't really represent a genuine David Vs Goliath in any shape or form. But the world has changed, and the other small browsers squaring up to the bigger players, including Firefox, does. The researchers are based in the UK and tested their various user journeys on Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Pro. There was no VPN in use, and so their location would have been readily available. As such, it’s not possible to determine from the report how widespread this is across other territories. But such claims about Microsoft's push to Edge are not limited to Mozilla’s report, and we have seen other recent complaints about Microsoft’s push to Edge. Despite this new research, these types of claim are not new, and we have seen similar   before, with Microsoft pushing users towards its ecosystem and Google doing the same,  . The backdrop to this current story, though, is Europe’s DMA, and the regulations that look to disrupt so-called gatekeepers and gateway platforms from doing exactly this kind of thing. The idea is that default apps can be changed, small players can compete, and house apps can be uninstalled if required. In its blogpost about the report, Mozilla says that “with the implementation of DMA in the European Union marking the start of a wave of global competition regulation, we hoped that the barriers to browser competition would be dismantled. However, even where there is movement in the right direction, improvements have been incomplete and are grudgingly offered only in markets where regulators have forced platform owners to make changes to respect browser choice.” Mozilla goes on to complain that “Microsoft recently pledged to stop some of the actions it takes to force Edge on users who have selected other browsers… [but] they will only be deployed to users in the EEA.” Windows users everywhere… continue to have their choices inhibited, overridden and undermined by Microsoft’s use of harmful design. Regulatory action around the world is needed to restore browser choice and competition across all of the major platforms.” I have reached out to Microsoft for a response to the Mozilla report."

Now, as Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signals U.S. interest rates should begin to fall later this year, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci has predicted the bitcoin price will surge to at least $170,000 per bitcoin after its April supply cut—which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $3.3 trillion. — Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has held U.S. interest rates steady but primed the market for a  \"Go back and look at bitcoin halving cycles,\" Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital who briefly served as former U.S. president Donald Trump's communications director, said during a   with trader Scott Melker. \"The day that bitcoin halves, multiply it by four [and] 18 months later and it’s been uncanny that that’s been the price of bitcoin.

It’s a $400,000 bitcoin, and I think it would be ridiculous for people not to understand the asset, not to understand the dynamics of it as a store of value and not to have a position.\" Meanwhile, traders are gearing up for a Fed interest rate cut that could mark the beginning of quantitative easing at around the same time as bitcoin's halving. The bitcoin price has bounced back from a brutal 2022 price crash, with some predicting it will  \"Bitcoin prices have realigned with futures market interest rate expectations, suggesting that bitcoin will become more responsive to interest rate sensitive macro data, such as payrolls and [consumer price index], especially as the excitement surrounding ETFs diminishes,\" CoinShares head of research James Butterfill     following Powell's press conference and referring to the fleet of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that began trading last month. \"The first rate cut will mean the beginning of the quantitative easing policy, and it is very important what the macro background would be at that particular moment,\" Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto company YouHodler, said in emailed comments. \"If the economy is in recession at that time, we will experience a drop in stocks and many other markets because investors will try as quickly as possible to move their capital to the bond or money market to fixate high interest rates for the following years.

That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

    "content": "Following an impressive reveal and popular pre-order window, Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones go on sale to the public today. And for those choosing Samsung's vision of smartphones, there are some tempting offers of free and discounted hardware alongside the new phones. Galaxy S24 Ultra on show at Galaxy Unpacked, January 17 2024, London, United Kingdom. The offers are not as wide-ranging as those in the pre-order window, which shouldn't be too surprising. The chance to bump up the onboard storage to the next tier was always going to be the most attractive offer, and hard to beat now the South Korean company is in full retail mode. Pre-orders tend to favor those buying their handsets SIM-free. I'd expect the majority of S24 sales to go through mobile carriers, which have a wide window of discounts they can offer thanks to the two-year-long contracts signed by consumers, allowing the financial impact of any offer to be spread over the 24 months of the contract. Here in the U.K., Samsung has an offer on top of any network or carrier offer. It has a free bundle of Galaxy Buds2Pro and SmartTag 2 for anyone who purchases a Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra from a wide range of networks and retailers during February. These need to be claimed from Samsung within 30 days of purchase. Ordering directly from Samsung U.K. opens up another tier of offers. Those purchasing either the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24+ will receive a 5% discount on their first purchase over £500 in the Samsung Shop App; and a 30% discount on both the Galaxy Watch6 Classic and two years of Samsung Care+. Finally, there’s a 12-month subscription to the Disney+ streaming service. You also have exclusive online colors; Sapphire Blue, Jade Green and Sandstone Orange for The S24 and S24+, and Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, or Titanium Orange for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I think Samsung would like you to know that the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses titanium as a material. As we saw with the pre-orders, the offers have regional variations. Those buying the S24 Ultra handsets in the U.S. can pick up discounts on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Galaxy Watch6 and Galaxy Watch6 Classic. At the same time, Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ owners have discount offers for the Galaxy Buds FE, Watch6 and Waatch6 Classic. Check your local listings for details, and remember that network pricing and offers may vary. Tthe flagship Galaxy S24 at Samsung's flagship store in Shanghai, China (CFOTO/Future Publishing via  Outside of the offers, the U.S. prices for SIM-free handsets—broadly indicative of other regions, are as follows; Samsung’s aggressive offers worldwide should boost sales of the Galaxy S24 family while the company has a short window of advantage. By bringing the launch date forward from the traditional mid-February slot ahead of Mobile World Congress, Samsung has not only a clear run with press coverage, but pre-orders and sales lock people into the handset and ecosystem for the next year or two before MWC highlights countless other premium smartphones. The Galaxy S24 launch is also comfortably clear of the Apple iPhone. The community that always buys iPhones will have made their purchases now, leaving a pool of less committed users to Apple’s vision. Samsung is facing an audience who want a reason to buy. The latest offers are making the Galaxy offer as tempting as possible."

    "title": "How New Bitcoin ETFs Effect The Bitcoin Price",
    "content": "A smart phone is displaying the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF stock on the NASDAQ market in this photo  The digital assets space has been fixated since BlackRock  announced its intentions to create a spot bitcoin ETF on June 15, 2023. Other companies had filed previously, but BlackRock only had one rejection out of over  , so anticipation was high. The mere possibility of the world’s largest asset manager creating a bitcoin ETF led to a 96% price rally up to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval on January 10. Therefore, it is pretty clear that bitcoin ETFs can at least indirectly affect the price of bitcoin. Yet, now we have nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., will there be a more direct impact on the bitcoin price? When investors buy or sell bitcoin on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, each trade directly affects bitcoin’s price, with the exchange’s order book matching buyers with sellers 24/7. The displayed bitcoin price is the average of what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are prepared to receive for their bitcoin. Therefore, whether an investor buys $10 or $1,000 worth of bitcoin on an exchange directly impacts the price in real time. These prices are then curated across all exchanges and trading pairs to give a global bitcoin price. Global   allow investors to identify potential arbitrage opportunities when prices differ across exchanges. These traders help ensure prices ultimately diverge toward a single value. Global combined bitcoin order book However, when it comes to bitcoin ETFs, things get more complicated. While the new spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the bitcoin price directly, they do not impact it in the same way. Buying a share of an ETF has no real-time impact on bitcoin’s price through direct means. In fact, the bitcoin represented by the share is not even purchased until the next trading day. Shares of the ETFs can only be created by organizations authorized in the issuer’s prospectus. These Authorized Participants for BlackRock include JP Morgan and Jane Street. APs submit an order for new shares to the ETF along with cash. The bitcoin reference rate is then set between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. EST and used to calculate the number of shares to issue. Once this is complete, the shares are delivered to the AP, and it can either offer them to the market or hold them on its balance sheet. When ETF shares are subsequently bought or sold, the price fluctuates like any other fund, but there is no direct impact on bitcoin. Shares can trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value when the correlation becomes decoupled. However, similar to how arbitrage opportunities across bitcoin exchanges help keep the price within a set range, bitcoin futures are often used to help keep bitcoin ETF shares in line. Whenever there is a substantial discount or premium to NAV for a bitcoin ETF, traders purchase or sell bitcoin futures on platforms such as CME to counteract the spread and collect the futures premium. Finally, to fulfill the APs’ orders, bitcoin is bought and sold over the counter with the institutional trading platform Coinbase Prime. These trades are less transparent as they are not included in the global combined order book. While transfers in and out of Coinbase Prime can be traced on-chain, internal off-chain transactions are not made public. The trades are peer-to-peer, with entities exchanging large amounts of bitcoin at a mutually agreed price. Public awareness of large bitcoin sales, such as those made recently by Grayscale, can make investors wary. However, the opaque nature of these large OTC trades and their lack of integration into global order books reduce their overall market impact on the bitcoin price. While there is sufficient liquidity at present to manage ETF demand within OTC desks, this may change in the future. The absolute maximum supply of the Bitcoin network is set at 21 million coins, and thousands of bitcoins enter ETFs daily. Conversely, only 900 BTC is mined every day, which will fall to 450 BTC within the next 80 days, following the next halving. If demand continues, the fixed supply of bitcoin may make it harder to create new ETF shares. At this point, the ETFs could substantially affect the bitcoin price, as ETFs may have to source bitcoin directly from exchanges. Ultimately, the effect on the bitcoin price will play out over months and years, not hours and days. The short-term anticipation and excitement for a spot bitcoin ETFs was perhaps overstated. However, the long-term impact may have been wildly understated."

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the many discussions around Apple in the last seven days. You can also  . The camera continues to be a battleground for smartphone manufacturers. 2024 has a difference, though, with the widespread use of AI being promoted by several manufacturers. Apple’s plans on the AI front are tied up in iOS 18 (which will likely be revealed in June at WWDC 2024). Until then, we have details on the hardware Apple will use to upgrade the Pro handsets: \"...this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count.\" ( ). A new Apple iPhone 15 Pro with box and packaging (Photo illustration by John Keeble/Getty Images). Although the iPhone 15 Pro represents the best iPhone that Apple is offering, customer satisfaction has fallen well below the iPhone 15, reports the team at Perfect Rec. Part of that may well be down to the high expectations the Apple community had for the 15 Pro, expectations that Apple did not meet: \"We suspect the early adopter phenomenon might also be responsible for the large changes in satisfaction rates on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models between September and October. They may have had higher expectations for the phones and been somewhat disappointed by incremental upgrades than people who bought later in the cycle and may have been upgrading from older models.\" ( ). The iPhone modem continues to be an area where Apple can't design and build its way out of a reliance on Qualcomm. The purchase of Intel's modem division in 2019 was part of a plan to take production in-house, a plan that has so far failed to produce a usable modem. That has left Apple little choice but to continue its relationship with Qualcomm. This week, it confirmed that the deal will run for another two years, out to 2027. \"...Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see further delays. Apple was initially aiming to have an Apple-designed modem chip ready to go by 2024, but it missed that target. The company then wanted to introduce the modem chip in an   that would launch in spring 2025, but it will not be able to make that goal either.\" ( ). Apple is—incredibly reluctantly—opening up its iPhone App Store and payment services. While Apple is working hard to retain as much control over what can be installed on the phone someone has purchased, these changes are now available to the European public. Will that be the end of it? \"...the changes which allow for rival app marketplaces to exist, which change Apple’s commission fees to app developers, will probably spread beyond the EU to affect everyone. The same will apply to the alterations to which web browser is the default choice on the iPhone. While many will welcome greater variety in app providers, and which web browser they can easily use, Apple says the new system could be less secure.\" ( ). The quiet accessory beloved by many iPad users is set for an update. Apple’s stylus, the eponymous Pencil, is getting “Find Mu” capabilities to make a lost stylus easier to find. \"The big news is that the software hints compatibility with Apple Find My will be built in to the next Pencil. That’s a first for Apple Pencil. It’s not clear whether this means the next model will have Ultra Wideband built in or not. If it does, you’ll be able to precisely find the Pencil (though, trust me, it’s almost always going to have slipped down between the cushions on the couch, so look there first).\" ( ). Ahead of the public release, several reviewers have received Apple Vision Pro headsets and are quietly pushing the envelope now they are at home and not in a controlled Apple Demo space. While the technical prowess can be clearly seen, the human impact is finally on show: \"And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device.\" ( ). What does it take to make a box for an Apple product? Trung Phan goes on a deep dive to find out: \"As the first stage of the iPhone experience, Apple put in 1000s of hours perfecting the package. There is literally a \"packaging room\" where a design employee will spend months opening up 100s of prototypes — with different materials and shapes — to nail the experience (I need footage of the Apple designer making a $500k annual salary, who’s locked up in this room once-a-year opening boxes until the fingers bleed).\" ( ).

    "content": "A Ukrainian 2S3 howitzer. When U.S. aid to Ukraine ran out in late December and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress refused to vote on Pres. Joe Biden’s proposal to spend another $61 billion on the war effort, Ukraine’s artillery batteries were the first to feel this betrayal. That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

    "title": "Why You Need To Delete These Apps From Your Android Phone Today",
    "content": "A serious new warning this week, with Android users urged to check their phones for a set of very dangerous apps, which not only steal personal data but can even record phone calls. If you have any of these installed, delete them immediately. Serious new warning suddenly issued for Android users This is just the latest such warning into malicious apps on both Google’s Play Store and the patchy collective of “user beware” third-party Android app stores. The VajraSpy remote access trojan (RAT) was identified by the research team at  , which has named “twelve Android espionage apps that share the same malicious code,” six of which “were available on Google Play,” despite its defenses. ESET attributes the RAT to the Patchwork APT group in Asia. The apps, the team says, “were advertised as messaging tools apart from one that posed as a news app—VajraSpy has a range of espionage functionalities that can be expanded based on the permissions granted to the app bundled with its code. It steals contacts, files, call logs, and SMS messages, but some of its implementations can even extract WhatsApp and Signal messages, record phone calls, and take pictures.” While there were very few installs from the Play Store, mostly confined to Asia, it’s not known how many apps were downloaded from third-party stores. Google’s official store is much more secure than the alternatives, but the fact these apps sneaked onto the Play Store in the first place will be a cause for alarm. These apps appear to have been more targeted than other recent malware warnings. Users were sent links through chat apps, often under the guise of online romance. But the apps have also been available on stores for anyone to install. Other malware-laced apps disclosed recently have been downloaded millions of times. The complete list of dangerous apps can be found below. Example of infected app This is the third such Android warning in recent weeks, following the SpyLoan and Xamalicious reports. And this one coincides with the current headlines on app store security. Apple has repeatedly pushed back on opening its own ecosystem to third-party stores for security reasons. It is now being forced to do so by way of Europe’s Digital Markets Act. Stories such as this will not provide much comfort. In response to ESET’s report, Google has   that “we take security and privacy claims against apps seriously,” and has confirmed that “all of the reported apps are no longer on Google Play,” adding that Google Play Protect can “warn of apps known to exhibit this malicious behavior on Android devices with Google Play Services, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.” Users should check for   and   apps as well as VajraSpy, all of which are detailed below. They should also look for any so-called “ ” hiding on their phones. Even though all these apps have been removed from the Play Store, some are still available in the wild and won’t have been automatically deleted. As I have said repeatedly, the dangers of sideloading will be much debated through 2024, ahead of Apple’s changes in iOS 17 updates and then iOS 18 in the fall. When Apple does begin to move beyond its App Store exclusivity, I suspect we will see much more focus on the vulnerabilities in the Android ecosystem, where the right balance between choice and risk is proving impossible to find. In addition to being wary of unofficial app stores, ESET strongly advises against installing apps via links sent through chat apps. “Cybercriminals wield social engineering as a powerful weapon. We strongly recommend against clicking any links to download an application that are sent in a chat conversation.” I would go further and advise against casual downloads of   apps onto your phone, unless you have confidence in their provenance and their developer. Once installed—and given rife permission abuse, apps can potentially access everything on your device, the key to your private life. Meanwhile, check your phone for the 40+ apps above, and maybe start to delete the casual apps you’ve collected over the years and no longer use. It’s good practice, especially at the moment, and you’d be well advised to do some housekeeping."

    "title": "Serious New Warning Issued For Millions Of Telegram Users",
    "content": "If Telegram is installed on your phone, then there are security and privacy risks you need to understand. But a new report has just warned of an even more dangerous threat to your phone from the messaging app, and one that is getting worse. New report warns of the serious threats hidden behind Telegram’s user-friendly façade There’s nothing quite like Telegram. A messaging platform you might use with your friends and colleagues, but which is also notorious for its use by criminals and terrorists, and which has almost become an easy access version of the dark web. That is certainly the findings of a new report this week from  . This messaging app,” it warns, “has transformed into a bustling hub where seasoned cybercriminals and newcomers alike exchange illicit tools and insights creating a dark and well-oiled supply chain of tools and victims’ data. Free samples, tutorials, kits, even hackers-for-hire—everything needed to construct a complete end-to-end malicious campaign.” Guardio researched the availability of so-called phishing kits on Telegram, used to attack phones and PCs. The phishing ecosystem, they say, has been democratized. “There was a time when kits, infrastructure, and know-how, were available only on invite-only forums in the Dark web, hidden behind Tor Onion networks. Today, they are readily and publicly available on Telegram—accessible via a simple search.” If you ever wonder why your email is increasingly peppered by fraudulent mails purporting to be from your bank or service provider, then this is why. Telegram has certainly hit the mainstream. One of the world’s five most downloaded apps, its press team says, with some 700 million active monthly users. “Telegram is committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. It has played a prominent role in pro-democracy movements around the world, including in Iran, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar and Hong Kong.” Contrast that with its darker side. Telegram has become the everyday storefront for build-your-own attacks that are then launched at the kind of people using the messaging platform as if it’s just a normal application. Illicit Telegram channels Telegram always had a healthy fan base, albeit somewhat outside the mainstream. But then WhatsApp had some Facebook difficulties in early 2021, and Telegram installs soared. For a while afterwards, it seemed everyone was jumping onboard. Putting its dark web credentials to one side, the irony with Telegram is that it talks up its security and privacy credentials, but it’s not actually as secure as WhatsApp. There’s no default end-to-end encryption, your message content is protected by policy, not technology. And in a world where Google Messages and even Facebook Messenger now end-to-end encrypt by default, this anomaly is hard to look past. But while that might be a threat to your privacy, it’s not a threat to your phone. Malware for hire or purchase, on the other hand, most certainly is. Mobile phishing is soaring, given the glued-to-hand nature of our devices, the increase in remote and hybrid working, and—critically—that phishing is just easier on mobiles. As   explains, “mobile is a vulnerable blind spot—the mobile device presents a fundamentally different environment from a laptop or desktop. They can give a significant leg up to attackers who use the smaller screens, simplified interfaces, and hidden URLs to their advantage. This, coupled with our natural tendency to immediately tap on anything that comes up on our smartphone or tablet screen, gives phishing attacks a higher chance of success.” And so to Telegram, Guardio describes the ease by which “one can stumble upon… public channels, groups, and bots bustling with thousands of participants… showcasing various products and services, tips and tricks, and knowledge you once had to dig deep into the dark web even to get close to” as startling. For example, they easily found “a phishing campaign targeting millions of Facebook business accounts… This campaign utilized Telegram channels to offer hijacked social accounts of victims targeted by phishing and malware. On sale are credentials and session cookies—many of them fresh out of the oven, hacked and stolen just hours or even minutes ago, and already available for sale.”  reported on this same Telegram issue last year, warning that “common users are not the only ones who have recognized the messaging app’s handy features—cybercrooks have already made it a branch of the dark web… Phishers create Telegram channels through which they educate their audience about phishing and entertain subscribers with polls like, ‘What type of personal data do you prefer?’” Guardio’s report walks through the ease by which would-be cyber criminals can set a phishing webpage, arrange its hosting, and even send out emails that link to their scam. “Our efforts soon start to bear fruit,” they reported. “Victims fall for the trap, clicking on the link and some even proceed to log into the fraudulent bank site—our scampage. Once they do this, their bank accounts become compromised.” Example scampage from Telegram It’s not just criminality on Telegram. It’s known for housing the darkest of content, such as Hamas terror channels in the Middle East. There were reports that the platform has banned access to this content,  . In reality, the platform has been infamous almost since its beginning for shielding illicit content from authorities, playing the anti-establishment role. What has changed is its campaign for legitimacy, which has included waging a social media battle with WhatsApp over which platform is safer and more secure. So, let’s be very clear. It doesn’t matter if WhatsApp is owned by Meta. The content you send is end-to-end encrypted and you can trust its security and stability. If you have concerns that there may be metadata tracks detailing your location and contact lists, perhaps even who you have messaged and when, then use Signal. As   warned last year, “Telegram’s developers position their product as safe and protected. But in practice that’s not entirely true. The reality is that Telegram has a number of quirks that make protecting your messages a little tricky… some rather dubious features in both the messenger’s interface and general logic make it less secure than is commonly believed.” Telegram told me that “since its creation, Telegram has actively moderated harmful content on our platform including malicious tools. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform and user reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service.” In reality, though, Telegram fails to offer a compelling messaging option given it still does not offer default end-to-end encryption, and with its previously more hidden, darker side now so close to the surface. My advice for most users is to steer clear. You can ignore the witty X account and banter with other platforms. This isn’t a game."

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 1st Impressions: 3 Features To Love",
    "content": "I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy S24 since minutes after it was announced on Wednesday, January 17. I’m working on my full review right now and it’ll be out next week. But right now, here are the three key features you need to know about. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The titanium frame, carefully sculpted to fit the hand comfortably despite the phone’s large size, looks and feels great. It has a semi-matte finish that is easy to grip. Then there’s the display which, unlike last year’s model, is flat, that is, there are no curved edges sloping down the sides. I like a curved screen but I have to say this display is tremendous. Not only does it mean you can write on more of the screen with the S Pen that slots into the phone’s body, it makes watching video on the inviting 6.8-inch display all the more immersive. The display is high resolution (505 pixels per inch) and it’s also very bright, up to 2,600 nits. Enough of the stats, this is a gorgeous display that you really can’t take your eyes off. Samsung is going big into AI. I’ve tested all the AI features and they work well—even if there is room to grow. The Translate feature, where you make a phone call to someone who uses a different language, is very neat. Initially, I worried that the opening gambit, where the person you’re calling hears a message saying, in their language, “Hello, this message is being translated and live captioned,” could be confusing, but we soldiered on. Booking a table at a restaurant was straightforward and quick. There were a couple of phrases which didn’t quite make it through the translation machine intact, but I ended the call confident my booking had been made. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. Then there’s the Transcription Assistant, which takes your recorded interview or meeting and turns it into text. I usually use the Recorder app on the Pixel, which is awesome, but this turned out to be even more accurate. It has the advantage that it’s done after you’ve finished the meeting (which can last anything from 20 seconds to three hours) and connects to the cloud to do it. But even when I said words that were unexpected and out-of-context, like parsnips and flatulence, it still transcribed me perfectly. This is very impressive. And then there’s Google Circle to Search, which lets you draw round an item on screen and it goes off to find out what you’re looking at. This is good already but could be great. Note that some of these AI features will also come to some earlier Galaxy phones. This is the feature we as users can never take for granted, even if it feels like the manufacturers do. The fast processor and bigger battery make for a highly efficient experience and, so far, I’ve been very impressed with how long this lasts. More to follow, but the first signs are looking very good."

    "title": "Russia Deployed Jammers To Beat Ukraine’s Drones, But They Don’t Work",
    "content": "A Russian MT-LB, fitted with an RP-377 jammer, burns. A Russian mechanized assault in the vicinity of Novomykhailivka, 10 miles west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, should sound alarms in the Kremlin. The Tuesday assault was small—just three T-72 tanks, seven MT-LB armored tractors and a single BMP-2 fighting vehicle, possibly from the Russian army’s 20th Motor Rifle Division. And its total destruction by Ukrainian drones in the span of three hours isn’t terribly unusual.  Russian attacks end in drone-inflicted defeat. No, what should worry Russian commanders is that the Ukrainian drones, apparently from the 79th Air Assault Brigade or the 7th Ranger Battalion, were unbothered by the electronic-warfare gear the Russians usually attach to their vehicles right before an attack. The E.W. systems broadcast radio noise that, in theory, should scramble the signals by which drone-operators control their two-pound, two-mile-range first-person-view drones, each laden with a pound of explosives. But during the Tuesday assault, any defensive jamming failed—and the drones swiftly demolished the Russian column. Russian forces “do not have any massive protection against enemy drones,” one Russian blogger complained in a missive   @wartranslated. “Everything they install has long been outdated and does not cover the enemy’s new frequencies.” For friends of a free Ukraine, this is good news. With pro-Russian Republicans in the U.S. Congress blockading U.S. aid to Ukraine, Kyiv’s artillery batteries are starved for ammunition: they’re firing just 2,000 rounds a day, a fifth what Russian batteries can fire. So Ukrainian troops are replacing artillery with FPV drones, which don’t require precision manufacturing and might cost just a few hundred dollars apiece. Ukraine is building, and flinging at Russian forces,  . Jamming has been Russia’s best defense against the swarm of Ukrainian drones, just as it’s been   best defense against a equally dense swarm of  drones. The difference is that Ukrainian jamming apparently still works. Russian jamming, on the other hand, may be failing. “The problem requires emergency measures,” the blogger intoned. As FPV drones replaced artillery as the most serious threat to Russian ground forces late last year, the Russian military responded by bolting, to its armored vehicles, whatever radio-jammers were available:   and   that magnetically stick to the outside of a tank. There was some risk the jammers would thwart Ukrainian drone operations. “I saw the spectrograms,” Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Beskrestnov wrote after inspecting a captured RP-377. “The interference is very high quality.” If that happened, it didn’t happen for long. Today Ukrainian drones are flying everywhere, all the time, along the 600-mile front of Russia’s wider war on Ukraine. While it helps that Ukrainian drone-operators   Russia’s most powerful fixed jammers, it may be even  helpful to Ukraine’s war effort that the shorter-range mobile jammers—Russian troops’ last-ditch defenses—seemingly aren’t jamming much of anything anymore. Maybe the blogger is right, and Ukrainian operators are hopping frequencies in order to dodge Russian jamming. Or maybe there’s some other trick, such as a built-in artificial intelligence that briefly takes over control of a drone when its human controller gets jammed. In any event, the Ukrainians seem to have found a viable approach to defensive firepower that buys them some time as their allies scramble to provide more artillery ammo—and as U.S. president Joe Biden   that allow him to overcome pro-Russia Republicans’ opposition to Ukraine’s self-defense. “It looks like this is the strategy of the Ukrainian armed forces,” a second Russian blogger  . “Going on the defensive, using drones, fairy tales about a shortage of shells.” Ukraine’s shell-shortage is real, in fact. But so is its drone-first approach to ground warfare. As Ukraine ramped up robotic strikes, Russia gambled on jammers to protect its troops. It seems to have been a losing bet."

    "title": "Amazon’s Flawed Password System Leads To More Stolen Packages",
    "content": "Amazon couriers are exploiting flaws in the one-time password system  An Amazon security system designed to ensure expensive items are delivered to the correct person is still backfiring on customers, 18 months after flaws in the system were first exposed. In July 2022, I   was being used to deny customers refunds for packages that were never delivered in the first place. The OTP system requires customers to give couriers a six-digit code before expensive items are handed over by the courier to the customer. But I reported on multiple cases in which customers who gave the correct code to the courier weren't given the expensive item, often when the person was receiving multiple packages at the same time and didn’t notice the expensive item was missing until the courier had left. Amazon customer support initially refused to refund affected customers, claiming that supplying the code was proof the expensive item was delivered. Since that July 2022 report, I’ve received a steady stream of complaints from customers who’ve experienced a range of problems with the OTP system. Tim Furdi from London has twice suffered as a consequence of Amazon’s OTP system. On the first occasion, a courier arrived at his London apartment to deliver a robot vacuum cleaner. The driver called Furdi when he arrived to deliver the package and said he needed the OTP to release the package to the concierge in his apartment block. But when Furdi went to collect the package from his concierge, no parcel had been left. “The driver was still there and he was adamant that he gave the parcel to reception, but reception denied that he had,” Furdi told me. “Then the driver became verbally abusive and left. I had to call Amazon many times about this and it took three weeks of internal investigations and checking footage before they refunded me.” Furdi had further OTP problems when he recently ordered a router. This time a driver arrived with a package and asked for the OTP, but after handing Furdi the parcel he “immediately realized it wasn’t mine, it was someone else’s,” Furdi said. The driver returned to his van to supposedly retrieve the correct package, but instead drove off. When Furdi contacted Amazon’s customer support he was told that “since I gave him the OTP there's not much they can do, they won't refund or redeliver.” The company has since fully refunded Furdi. It seems rogue couriers have found other ways to beat Amazon’s OTP system, too. Another reader contacted me to complain that their Google Pixel phone had supposedly been delivered while they were out, without ever giving the OTP to the driver. The reader claimed that in cases when the customer is unable to provide an OTP, courier drivers can instead use digits from the customer’s cell phone number as proof of identity. Amazon doesn’t provide drivers with the customers’ phone numbers, but drivers can call customers using an Amazon system where the number is hidden. In this instance, the call went through to the customer’s voicemail, which has a generic message stating “you have reached the answerphone service for” and then proceeds to read out the customer’s number. The driver allegedly used these details to bypass the OTP security system and steal the package. Amazon customer services refused to offer a refund, claiming the delivery was confirmed by OTP. , where the courier rings them and tricks them into giving them their phone number, again using this to bypass the OTP and keep the package, which they know will contain an expensive item. “We work hard to understand the circumstances around every case and find a resolution with the customer. Customer satisfaction is our utmost priority, and we’re sorry that customer experiences in these cases did not meet the high standards we expect,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “We have implemented additional controls that are already making it even harder for bad actors to defraud customers, selling partners and Amazon. We are collaborating with the authorities, and are working tirelessly to improve the customer experience in these cases.”"

    "title": "Biden Arms Greece So Greece Arms Ukraine. Republicans Can’t Stop It.",
    "content": "A Greek air force C-130. As the Republican Party’s blockade of aid to Ukraine drags into its fourth month, the U.S. government under Pres. Joe Biden has found a clever new way to give Ukraine’s forces the weapons and ammunition they need to defend their country. It is, in essence, an American version of Germany’s circular weapons trade— . The United States is gifting older surplus weapons to Greece with the understanding that Greece donates to Ukraine some of its  surplus weapons. Greek media broke the news last week. According to the newspaper  and other media, the Biden administration offered the Greek government three 87-foot  -class patrol boats, two Lockheed Martin C-130H airlifters, 10 Allison T56 turboprop engines for Lockheed P-3 patrol planes plus 60 M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and a consignment of transport trucks. All this hardware is U.S. military surplus—and is available to Greece, free of charge, under a U.S. legal authority called   Federal law allows an American president to declare military systems surplus to need, assign them a value—potentially zero dollars—and give them away on the condition that the recipient transport them. The law caps annual EDA transfers at $500 million. The same law   dictate the  the president assigns to surplus weapons. In a letter to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken   the ships, planes, engines and vehicles as “free concessions.” The EDA gifts to Greece sweeten a larger arms package that includes 40 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, which Greece is buying for $8.6 billion. The Biden administration previously approved, in 2022 and 2023, $60 million in financing for arms-purchases by Athens. In exchange for this largess, the Americans want the Greeks to donate more weapons to the Ukrainians. “We continue to be interested in the defense capabilities that Greece could transfer or sell to Ukraine,” Blinken wrote. The Americans even offered a reward once the donation is complete. “If these capabilities are of interest to Ukraine, and pending an assessment of their status and value by the U.S. government, we can explore opportunities for possible additional foreign armed forces financing of up to $200 million for Greece.” The Greek military operates, or holds in storage, an array of Soviet- and U.S.-designed weaponry that would be of immediate value to the Ukrainian military—in particular, S-300 and Hawk long-range air-defense batteries, Tor and Osa short-range air-defense vehicles and ZU-23-2 air-defense guns. Also: ammunition for all these systems. Some or all of those weapons could be heading to Ukraine. “Political and military leadership has already given the necessary directions so that obsolete systems and equipment that are no longer used by the Greek army are transferred to Ukraine,”  . The Greek ring-transfer was a delicate one, as tensions between Greece and Turkey mean the United States usually offers both countries new weapons at the same time—and in roughly the same quantity. So it’s no accident that, simultaneous with the Greek arms deal, the U.S. State Department cleared Turkey to spend $23 billion on 40 new Lockheed F-16 fighters and 79 upgrade kits for older F-16s, plus munitions for the fighters. The deal also was a reward for Turkey finally consenting to Sweden joining NATO. Germany’s  program has speeded to Ukraine scores of tanks and other heavy weapons. America’s  ring trade could do the same—potentially on an even grander scale. Greece isn’t the only country with old weapons that it might give away, if the United States offers something in return. That Biden and his secretary of state Blinken are backing an EDA-based ring-trade should come as no surprise to close observers of American politics. Last fall, pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress made it clear they probably never will approve direct military aid to Ukraine. The Republicans are falling in line with disgraced ex-president Donald Trump’s personal hatred of Ukraine—and equally personal fondness for authoritarian Russia. The Republicans’ allegiance to Trump—and therefore to dictators and military aggressors—wasn’t an issue for Ukraine until they narrowly gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2022 elections. When earlier funding for Ukraine ran out in late December, Rep. Mike Johnson—the extremist House speaker—refused to put additional aid to a vote. So barring a legislative breakthrough, Biden can’t get the additional $61 billion in clean funding he wants for Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean he can’t honor the wishes of the majority of Americans and help Ukraine to defend itself. Biden’s EDA authority is one of several legal mechanisms at his disposal that can free up older weapons for onward transfer to Ukraine. And while Biden could send excess defense articles directly to Ukraine, he initially is using EDA as leverage in ring trades. Expect more of this as Republicans and Trump increasingly side with Russia in Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine. The Republicans might be eager to betray Ukraine; Biden however  ."

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Will Have Key Design Omissions, Insider Claims",
    "content": "When the iPhone 16 series arrives this fall, almost certainly, it may have two glaring omissions which could lead to less stellar sales, a new report claims. Not only will there be no “significant design changes” but one key driver of sales, generative AI, is not going to arrive at scale on the iPhone “until 2025 at the earliest.” Apple iPhone 15 Pro. How different will the iPhone 16 series be? Does this seem right? Well, it could be, because the report comes from one of the most reliable analysts out there, Ming-Chi Kuo from TFI Securities. Kuo’s   claims that Apple has “lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments of key upstream semiconductor components” by 15% compared to the year before, adding that this could mean “the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024.” Kuo claims that this is down to, “a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design.” Kuo goes on to explain that this is because when people are choosing pricey cellphones, they are now looking at two different elements, AI and foldables. But hold on, you say, we weren’t expecting a foldable iPhone, but isn’t AI coming to the iPhone this year? There certainly have been strong rumors that Apple will announce big changes to iOS at WWDC in June, and it may even be the biggest update ever. But Kuo says that Apple “will not launch… the more comprehensive/differentiated GenAI ecosystem/applications until 2025 at the earliest.” Let’s put this a bit more positively. If it’s right that big AI changes are coming to iOS 18, as predicted, then hold on to your hats for what’s coming next year. Kuo also claims that there will be a “continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,” because of the preference for a foldable phone at the premium end of the market, alongside “the return of Huawei”, the brand which had been flailing since restrictions on international product sales were placed on it, but has seen a resurgence in the last few months. How much will the next iPhone design differ from this one? The report also says “Apple will not launch new iPhone models with significant design changes,” again, not until 2025 or later. Of course, there have already been reports of new updates to the iPhone 16 range. These include  , wider implementation of the exceptional  , a new strategy for its  , more advanced  , noticeably  , a new thermal design to  , improved  , a new microphone   an  , designed for shooting video and an improved  . I mean, that’s quite a list, and you may feel that if all the above are delivered, that they add up to significant design changes already. And it’s only February! Plenty more leaks could appear before the fall. Again, if Kuo reckons that 2025’s improvements will be on a much bigger scale than this year’s, then I can’t wait."

    "title": "Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds Long-Term Review: Refined Excellence",
    "content": "Sony WF-1000XM5 case The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds have been my travel companion for the past two months now. There’s plenty to like – the sound, the battery life, improved active noise cancelation (ANC) and a more compact design. While comfort and fit remain subjective, Sony has introduced some significant changes, but not all of them translate to a better experience. I had one prominent issue with the Sony XM4 earbuds – the size. That’s because it felt too big to fit in my pockets alongside the phone. Sony has worked on it and reduced WF-1000XM5 dimensions, so it’s noticeably smaller and much more portable, which I love. The difference is more noticeable when you open the case because the earbuds have been shrunk too. As per the company, the earbuds are 25% smaller than the predecessor, and 20% lighter. If you have used the XM4s, you’d be delighted to put in the XM5s in your ears because they no longer feel bulky. It’s a significant improvement in design but not in material used. The matte and glossy finish looks classy but the glossy finish on the earbuds’ sides causes issues. In my time with the XM5s, there have been zero (okay, almost zero) instances where I was able to take out the earbuds from the case in one try until I figured out the correct way of plucking them out. Push-and-pull the earbuds instead of pulling with two fingers You need to push and pull with a thumb and finger instead of pull with two fingers to get them out of the case. The glossy material provides no grip, so if you have sweaty or greasy fingers, you are going to struggle with them unless you use the thumb method. Ideally, taking out the earbuds and putting them in your ears should be a natural, seamless experience, but it isn’t on the Sony WF-1000XM5. The earbuds come with proprietary foam tips. You get four of them in the box, including extra small, small, medium and large. If you put them in and realize that the ANC isn’t effective, that’s because these tips don’t work like silicone tips. You need to insert and twist, so they expand to seal the ears and perform as intended with ANC on. You can always swap them for silicone eartips if the new foam material doesn’t feel comfortable to you. Like before, the XM5 earbuds are rated IPX4 for sweat resistance. The Sony WF-1000XM5 comes equipped with all-new 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X, which is larger than the 6.4mm found on the XM4s. According to Sony, this helps reduce mechanical noise, which is hard to notice. The earbuds support SBC, AAC and LDAC codecs. For Android phones, LDAC offers better sound but isn’t enabled by default on all the devices, so be mindful of turning it on. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbud The Sony XM5 earbuds bring in more clarity and dynamics. I enjoyed listening to songs that have acoustic guitar or piano playback with vocals being clear. The earbuds sound more open than before. While the XM4 had more thumping bass response, these sound more controlled, detailed and overall better in lower frequencies. The treble is more refined too. All of this is with ANC on, but turn the noise cancelation off, and you’ll get a more natural sound. The WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature six microphones, a bone conduction sensor and a noise reduction engine with AI machine learning to offer a better calling experience than before. I was thoroughly impressed with the call quality and wind reduction tech. These are some of the best earbuds for calls. You can also use head gestures (can be toggled in the Headphones app) to accept or reject calls. But they don’t work 100% of the time. You can choose from Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa for voice assistance. I set up Alexa and making hands-free calls by saying the trigger word and command worked eight out of 10 times. The new Sony earbuds feature a new integrated processor V2 and HD Noise Canceling processor QN2e that work together to bring top-notch ANC performance. I’ve been on a few flights, and these have been my go-to earbuds for travel because these the ANC doesn’t give a vacuum-like effect that could make your ears uncomfortable. It’s right up there or even a notch better than AirPods Pro 2’s ANC but I prefer Apple’s transparency mode. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds case back In terms of features, you get dynamic head tracking, which is cool to have but I prefer having it off. The app offers a quick optimization process to fine-tune the head tracking, which works with Netfix and YouTube to offer a more immersive experience. The Sony XM5 earbuds support multipoint connectivity so you can connect to two devices simultaneously. It works flawlessly. Other Sony-exclusive features like Speak-to-Chat and Adaptive Sound Control are present too. The latter controls the amount of ambient sound to push in your ears depending on where you are and what you’re doing. For instance, you can have ANC off when you’re moving. Notably, it requires your location data to work. One of the worst parts of non-stem earbuds design is that you are limited by controls because there’s only so many things you can do with a few taps. But on the XM5s, you can customize them for play/pause, ANC modes and volume – all at the same time, like the  . For reference, the XM4s didn’t let you operate all three together, and you could only choose two out of these three functionalities. The Sony WF-1000XM5 can last up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, while the charging case adds another 24 hours of playback time. You get wireless charging support and fast charging that can give you an hour worth of battery life with a three-minute charge. I didn’t find myself out of charge when needed. The battery life is better than the AirPods Pro 2 (six hours). Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds in black The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature a new design that’s smaller, lighter and more comfortable than before. There’s a minor inconvenience that you can make peace with because you get rich, clear and immersive sound and call quality. The ANC performance is top-class too. The Sony WF-1000XM5 remain the earbuds to beat in terms of sound, features and ANC. At $280 / 24,990 INR, these are an easy recommendation for Android users. These perform well with the iPhone too but AirPods Pro 2 offer a more seamless experience."

    "title": "Your iPhone Will Never Be The Same Again With Massive New iOS 17.4 Upgrade",
    "content": "The next big iOS update, iOS 17.4, is due in early March. It has  , including an update to the cool new   which has just launched. But Apple has more than striking new features in the update, and it could change the iPhone forever. Apple iOS 17.4 will radically change your iPhone. Just as important are the changes which are coming for iPhone users in the EU, which will significantly open up the device to third-party influences. Is that a good or a bad thing, and will users outside the EU see these changes? Read about the originally announced changes  , and read on for the latest analysis. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, in his most recent  , describes the changes as a sweeping overhaul of the software that powers the iPhone. While it’s currently affecting iOS, the App Store and the Safari browser in the EU, it “is more than just a local change. It’s a peek at the future of the platform and one that the company will likely have to adopt globally.” In other words, the changes which allow for rival app marketplaces to exist, which change Apple’s commission fees to app developers, will probably spread beyond the EU to affect everyone. The same will apply to the alterations to which web browser is the default choice on the iPhone. While many will welcome greater variety in app providers, and which web browser they can easily use, Apple says the new system could be less secure. Gurman points out that all this will affect Apple’s bottom line, as well as the iPhone’s security and privacy—and these are elements Apple takes seriously. He says, “As it frees up the iPhone’s software, the company is rolling out a slew of new anti-malware tools and warnings for both consumers and developers. It’s even requiring apps downloaded outside its App Store to go through a light review process and notarization.” Apple has new terms for developers who are thinking of moving from the App Store to rival marketplaces. The company has spelt out a deal which will save developers significant sums if they stay with Apple’s current ecosystem by cutting commission levels. For those developers who choose a different way, however, the result is reduced revenue for Apple, which it aims to make up for with new fees, such as the Core Technology Fee. This requires payments for each app install. Though the individual fee is low, $0.54, or 0.5€, and though this cost only kicks in above the first million installations, it all adds up. Gurman says, “Apple says that 99% of developers will see the amount they pay stay the same or decline. That all sounds great until you dive into the core technology fee, which feels like it was designed to strike right at Spotify, Meta and other large developers that offer their apps for free.” What’s clear is that from early March, the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, will change radically, in the EU at least. Apple’s changes have come as a response to the Digital Marketplace Act, and may change further, but the future is clearly going to be very different from where we are now. As Gurman says, “It all adds up to an iPhone that’s more customizable and less hostile to outside software.” Satisfying EU regulators may lead to a new era for the iPhone, and it could change how we use the phone as a result, potentially everywhere. Will there be changes to the software beyond what has already been announced? Stay tuned."

    "title": "Google Issues Surprise New Warning For Samsung Galaxy Users",
    "content": "Android users may have plenty to look forward to, with Google   radical new AI releases. But a new update warning has suddenly started hitting Samsung Galaxy devices, which is reportedly annoying users and raising serious questions on timing. Google’s ‘annoying’ warning now being seen on Galaxy devices While it’s Apple making   over its App Store changes in response to Europe’s DMA—including aping Android’s sideloading to some extent at least, it seems that Google is also tightening up its traditionally relaxed approach. Starting last year, Google has been warning owners of its Pixel devices when they download Google apps from anything other than its Play Store. As  reported at the time, this new update ownership “lets third-party app stores become the exclusive source of future automatic updates to an app they first installed.” But now,  reports that “Google has expanded warning dialogs for sideloaded app updates to non-Pixel phones and non-Google apps.” This “annoying 'update ownership' warning” will be a surprise for users who expect to install what they want from where they want, trading risk for flexibility. This has always been the draw for Android, making it so different from Apple’s locked down iPhone. The warning itself links back to the concept of app ownership introduced with Android 14. Essentially, an app store can mandate provenance over an install, triggering a warning if an update is requested from elsewhere. While this ostensibly relates to integrity and functionality, there’s clearly a major security angle as well. While the warning dialog is not alarming, it will be unexpected and not something owners of Samsung and other Android devices expect to see. “This is our first clear indication,”  points out, “that Google is ready to spread these warnings beyond Pixel phones and Google apps/services.” Ordinarily, this story might slip by with little passing interest. The warning appears just once—it’s more an inconvenience than anything else. While this   started to appear on non-Google devices for non-Google apps, it’s not yet widespread and so will not yet have “annoyed” the likely millions of impacted users. A Google spokesperson told me that \"we introduced several new APIs in Android 14 that allow app stores, including third-party stores, to improve their user experience.” The warnings are not device specific and relate to the app store concerned. “When you install an app from a store, you typically expect to receive automatic updates for the app from that same store. With Android 14, if a store claims responsibility for future updates for the apps you install through it, then Android ensures that you won't unexpectedly receive updates for these apps from a different store.” I was told that “as stores, including Google Play, adopt the Android 14 change, users who subsequently update apps from different sources may notice this message.” But from the outside, the exact timing of this remains notable, just as Apple trades headlines over the security and privacy risks—or not—in sideloading, with regulators reportedly watching its own DMA-induced implementation with interest. As my colleague Kate O’Flaherty reported on  , “iOS 17.4 will be welcomed by iPhone users in the EU who would like the same flexibility Google’s Android users enjoy. But Apple has warned that sideloading and the associated changes to iOS and its ecosystem as a result open up iPhone users to major security risks.” In the last few weeks, I have reported on the latest wave of Play Store malware plaguing Android devices. First SpyLoan, then Xamalicious, and finally a research note warning about the scourge of “copycat apps.” Each of those warnings covered some limited Play Store installs, but primarily concerned the much less secure and controlled third party stores. This is the balance that Apple says it now needs to strike. Providing the seeming competitive freedom demanded by the EU, while maintaining its security credentials. Apple genuinely does need to navigate a path through this. While prompted by good intentions and instincts, I suspect most iPhone users are wary of lessening the famed security credentials of their devices. Arguably, users can choose the locked down iPhone or open Android ecosystem. That choice in Europe is now diminished. “We’re trying to strike a balance,”   of Google’s own efforts in this area—but taking a different angle to Apple. “We believe in choice,” he said, “so on Android we allow you to sideload and install additional applications.” But Pichai also sounded a warning that there’s a user risk in stepping outside the formal channels, where it has focused significant resources in recent years in shoring up security. It’s just like a seatbelt, he said. Users can choose to use them. or not. Until now, there has been a clear divide. Apple has a blanket ban on sideloading, and Google is pretty open. It has not been possible to directly compare and contrast the security and protections available, given those different approaches. But now it’s all change, and for the first time the playing field has been somewhat leveled. And so we watch with interest to see what Apple delivers in practice—and how that lands with regulators, and then how Google responds. Which is why the timing of this latest warning is interesting and why this story is worth watching as it develops."

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: New Report Claims Bold Upgrade Coming",
    "content": "Cameras are a key component on every smartphone, and it looks like the next iPhones will see a photographic improvement, at least in the larger version of the Pro iPhone released this fall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Here’s what’s coming. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: will the iPhone 16 Pro have a bigger camera sensor? According to Weibo user Digital Chat Station, in a report picked up by  , this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count. The new report claims that this year’s Max will be an “image flagship”. I mean, it is already. This report contrasts with other rumors that the Pro and Pro Max would have photographic capabilities that were closer to each other than this year, where the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a 5x zoom in its telephoto, but the iPhone 15 Pro only has room for a 3x zoom. That rumor still stands, that both Pro and Pro Max will have 5x zoom on the telephoto lens. But the Max, it seems, will still outstrip the regular Pro photographically, this time on the main camera sensor. The pixel count, the report claims, will stay at 48 megapixels for both phones. But the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a stacked design, which promises better performance. There’ll be a better Analog to Digital Converter and better noise control. Most important of all, the sensor size will increase from the 1/1.28 inch sensor found on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro, to a 1/1.14 inch sensor. That 12% size increase could promise significantly improved low-light performance, as well as greater dynamic range and improved background blur for better bokeh effects. This could all be done without increasing the thickness of the phone. More details will leak, but this is a promising upgrade for all iPhone users who enjoy taking the best photographs with the least effort."

    "title": "On Ukraine, Republicans Can’t Win. Joe Biden Can Send Excess Weapons.",
    "content": "Surplus M-1 tanks at the Sierra Army Depot in California. Pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress for months have been withholding $61 billion in vital military aid to Ukraine. They’ve been betting that, by linking a fresh round of aid to unprecedented restrictions on immigration and asylum, they can either: get U.S. president Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers to agree to a raft of new xenophobic policies; or at least sow political chaos that they believe will benefit them in upcoming elections. But Republicans aren’t “negotiating”—or, more accurately, “extorting”—from a position of strength. Because Biden has a   veto over  veto of aid to Ukraine. One he either doesn’t yet fully appreciate or, more likely, is saving for an emergency. It’s a classification for older weaponry the U.S. government calls   or EDA. The government has the legal authority to sell extremely cheaply—or even give away—any U.S. military hardware that U.S. forces no longer need. Biden only rarely has used his EDA authority to send weapons to Ukraine. Instead, he has leaned more heavily on his separate Presidential Drawdown Authority to send to Ukraine newer weapons that U.S. forces otherwise still might use. But the way Biden has used PDA requires the Pentagon immediately to pay for replacement weapons for its own forces. It’s money for those replacements—as well as financing for other arms production for Ukraine—that Biden largely is asking for in his supplemental funding proposal. All that is to say, Biden needs Republicans if he’s going to continue supporting Ukraine via his drawdown authority. He   need Republicans if he instead falls back on his  authority. EDA might be the,  , trump card that Biden is saving in this escalating political game. A game where, tragically, the stakes are Ukrainian lives. U.S. president Joe Biden perhaps was optimistic when, last fall, he proposed to federal lawmakers a $106-billion supplemental spending bill that would fund military aid to Taiwan, Israel and—to the tune of $61 billion—Ukraine. When Democrats from Biden’s own political party fully controlled Congress, approval might’ve been swift. But Republicans gained narrow control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the mid-term election in November 2022. Increasingly under the sway of authoritarians including disgraced former U.S. president Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, House Republicans refused to approve the funding. And holding hands with fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate, they tied further aid to Ukraine to immigration and border “reforms.” In short, the Republicans demanded more arrests and less immigration across the border. Biden swiftly signaled he would accept new restrictions along the border if that freed up aid to Ukraine. A trio of U.S. senators—one Republican, one Democrat and an independent—began negotiating a border and immigration bill. The gang of three senators could release the text of the bill as soon as this week. But the speaker of the House, Louisiana Republic Mike Johnson—a political novice who backed Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost—denounced the new bill even before he read it. \"I don't think now is the time for comprehensive immigration reform because we know how complicated that is,” Johnson  , even though  was one of the Republican leaders who  comprehensive immigration reform as a condition of further aiding Ukraine. Barring some unlikely cross-party alliances, Johnson alone can bring a bill to a vote in the House. Apparently growing impatient, Biden called Johnson and other Congressional leaders to a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, the main subject of which was Ukraine. Johnson emerged less strident than when he entered. “We understand the necessity about Ukraine funding,” he  . We don’t know what Biden said to Johnson, but it’s possible he explained that there still are legal tools at Biden’s disposal for sending military aid to Ukraine—tools that don’t require Johnson and his party to do  . It’s possible, in other words, that Biden played the EDA card—and emphasized to Johnson that there are two potential outcomes as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds toward its third year and Ukrainian troops run low on weaponry. One, Johnson and his fellow Republicans can trade new border policies for $61 billion in Ukraine aid and “win” this political game. Or they can withhold aid, compel Biden to lean on his EDA authority and get nothing in return as fresh aid begins to flow. The list of military hardware Biden could donate or sell cheaply to Ukraine is a long one. It grows longer if Ukraine can tap financing from its European allies in order to pay a higher premium for older American weapons. The list includes tanks,  , trucks, naval patrol boats and even retired F-16 fighters. Enough weaponry to keep Ukrainian forces in the fight for years.   , but they’re ... fungible. The president can give away old weapons that have no commercial value, but the recipient has to pay for shipping. The law also limits the total annual value of EDA transfers to just $500 million. But the same law   strictly dictate how government officials value a particular excess weapon. If the Biden administration decides, say,  —thousands of which are in storage in U.S Army arsenals—is worth just a few thousand dollars, there’s not much that lawmakers can do to stop Biden from sending hundreds of M-1s to Ukraine on trains and ships that Ukraine charters. If Republicans have healthy political instincts, they’ll vote for the forthcoming Senate immigration compromise and unlock aid to Ukraine. If they   have healthy political instincts, and Biden  , the next big batches of American weapons for Ukraine could come from the vast stocks of Excess Defense Articles."

People around me have mistaken it for a premium smartphone because of the striking design. The style quotient is combined with a dedicated telephoto lens, which isn’t the norm in the price range yet. These factors make it stand out but is that enough to compete with Redmi, iQOO and Poco? The Realme 12 Pro Plus is one of the most stylish phones that you can buy right now. I liked the finish of the   purple version but this one looks even better. When compared to the predecessor, it features a redesigned camera module. The gold trim around the cameras and on the back stays, which gives it a premium look. The phone is rated IP65 for dust and water resistance. At 196 grams, the Realme 12 Pro Plus is light and comfortable to use for a big phone. The volume and power buttons are easy to each and the curved edges of the screen make it feel thinner than it is. It features a 6.7-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, and a 950 nits peak brightness with a 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. Realme 12 Pro Plus display In harsh lighting, you’d want it to get brighter. The display supports 2160Hz PWM dimming, so it’s comfortable on the eyes. It’s a vivid panel with HDR 10 support and Hi-Res dual speakers with Dolby Atmos support. However, Netflix doesn’t support HDR on this phone. The display also brings ProXDR for a brighter viewing experience. But overall, I prefer the screen on the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus. The Realme 12 Pro Plus is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. In my five days with the phone, I haven’t experienced stutters or lags, which is what you’d expect from a device in this range. However, it isn’t meant for extensive gaming sessions. It is paired with 8GB/12GB of LPDD4X RAM and 128GB/256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The in-display fingerprint scanner is accurate and reliable. The new Realme phone sports a triple rear camera setup that is led by a 50MP Sony IMX890 primary camera. It is accompanied by a 64MP OV64B periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom support and an 8MP ultrawide-angle camera. On the front lies a 32MP selfie shooter. Realme 12 Pro Plus 3x portraits The shots from the primary camera are detailed with good dynamic range. I focused more on the 3x and 6x zoom camera performance for this hands-on. While the former is optical, 6x is in-sensor zoom, which is better than digital zoom, which can go up to 120x. I liked the shots captured at 3x , especially the ones in portrait mode, which had nice bokeh and good edge detection. The portrait shots look great for the price. The ultrawide camera performance is decent but nothing extraordinary. The Realme 12 Pro Plus runs Android 14-based Realme UI 5.0 that offers a cleaner look than before but you still get notifications from App Market and Theme Store – despite not being connected to the internet. The company is promising two years of major software and three years of security updates with the Realme 12 Pro Plus, so it should last you till 2027. Realme 12 Pro Plus with the 11 Pro Plus in background The Realme 12 Pro Plus packs a 5,000mAh battery that supports 67W fast charging, and you get the SuperVOOC charger in the box. While it’s a downgrade from 100W on the 11 Pro Plus, I prefer having 67W if that gives a brand the ability to add a telephoto camera. It can charge the device from 5% to 50% within 20 minutes, which remains superfast. This is not a full review, but in my time, the phone seemed to last a day with ease. The Realme 12 Pro Plus starts at 29,999 for the 8GB + 128GB variant. Looking at the competition, the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus offers a better display and performance with IP68 rating at INR 31,999, which is the same as the 8GB and 256GB storage variant of the Realme phone. If you need a smartphone for extensive gaming sessions, look at the Poco X6 Pro. However, if you want a smartphone that looks stylish and offers 3x optical zoom that can capture amazing portrait shots, you should consider the Realme 12 Pro Plus."

    "title": "Biden Arms Greece So Greece Arms Ukraine. Republicans Can’t Stop It.",
    "content": "A Greek air force C-130. As the Republican Party’s blockade of aid to Ukraine drags into its fourth month, the U.S. government under Pres. Joe Biden has found a clever new way to give Ukraine’s forces the weapons and ammunition they need to defend their country. It is, in essence, an American version of Germany’s circular weapons trade— . The United States is gifting older surplus weapons to Greece with the understanding that Greece donates to Ukraine some of its  surplus weapons. Greek media broke the news last week. According to the newspaper  and other media, the Biden administration offered the Greek government three 87-foot  -class patrol boats, two Lockheed Martin C-130H airlifters, 10 Allison T56 turboprop engines for Lockheed P-3 patrol planes plus 60 M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and a consignment of transport trucks. All this hardware is U.S. military surplus—and is available to Greece, free of charge, under a U.S. legal authority called   Federal law allows an American president to declare military systems surplus to need, assign them a value—potentially zero dollars—and give them away on the condition that the recipient transport them. The law caps annual EDA transfers at $500 million. The same law   dictate the  the president assigns to surplus weapons. In a letter to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken   the ships, planes, engines and vehicles as “free concessions.” The EDA gifts to Greece sweeten a larger arms package that includes 40 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, which Greece is buying for $8.6 billion. The Biden administration previously approved, in 2022 and 2023, $60 million in financing for arms-purchases by Athens. In exchange for this largess, the Americans want the Greeks to donate more weapons to the Ukrainians. “We continue to be interested in the defense capabilities that Greece could transfer or sell to Ukraine,” Blinken wrote. The Americans even offered a reward once the donation is complete. “If these capabilities are of interest to Ukraine, and pending an assessment of their status and value by the U.S. government, we can explore opportunities for possible additional foreign armed forces financing of up to $200 million for Greece.” The Greek military operates, or holds in storage, an array of Soviet- and U.S.-designed weaponry that would be of immediate value to the Ukrainian military—in particular, S-300 and Hawk long-range air-defense batteries, Tor and Osa short-range air-defense vehicles and ZU-23-2 air-defense guns. Also: ammunition for all these systems. Some or all of those weapons could be heading to Ukraine. “Political and military leadership has already given the necessary directions so that obsolete systems and equipment that are no longer used by the Greek army are transferred to Ukraine,”  . The Greek ring-transfer was a delicate one, as tensions between Greece and Turkey mean the United States usually offers both countries new weapons at the same time—and in roughly the same quantity. So it’s no accident that, simultaneous with the Greek arms deal, the U.S. State Department cleared Turkey to spend $23 billion on 40 new Lockheed F-16 fighters and 79 upgrade kits for older F-16s, plus munitions for the fighters. The deal also was a reward for Turkey finally consenting to Sweden joining NATO. Germany’s  program has speeded to Ukraine scores of tanks and other heavy weapons. America’s  ring trade could do the same—potentially on an even grander scale. Greece isn’t the only country with old weapons that it might give away, if the United States offers something in return. That Biden and his secretary of state Blinken are backing an EDA-based ring-trade should come as no surprise to close observers of American politics. Last fall, pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress made it clear they probably never will approve direct military aid to Ukraine. The Republicans are falling in line with disgraced ex-president Donald Trump’s personal hatred of Ukraine—and equally personal fondness for authoritarian Russia. The Republicans’ allegiance to Trump—and therefore to dictators and military aggressors—wasn’t an issue for Ukraine until they narrowly gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2022 elections. When earlier funding for Ukraine ran out in late December, Rep. Mike Johnson—the extremist House speaker—refused to put additional aid to a vote. So barring a legislative breakthrough, Biden can’t get the additional $61 billion in clean funding he wants for Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean he can’t honor the wishes of the majority of Americans and help Ukraine to defend itself. Biden’s EDA authority is one of several legal mechanisms at his disposal that can free up older weapons for onward transfer to Ukraine. And while Biden could send excess defense articles directly to Ukraine, he initially is using EDA as leverage in ring trades. Expect more of this as Republicans and Trump increasingly side with Russia in Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine. The Republicans might be eager to betray Ukraine; Biden however  ."

    "content": "If you’ve updated to the latest iPhone software, iOS 17.3, you’ll know that the key new feature was Stolen Device Protection, so if someone steals your iPhone, heaven forbid, and knows your passcode, their ability to get into your digital life or remove you from your phone, is significantly curtailed. Now it’s emerged that an upgrade is on its way pronto. Apple releases iOS 17.3. The next update is already almost here. As you may know, Apple is releasing an update to its iPhone software in time to meet a deadline from the European Union so it can comply with the Digital Markets Act. While that doesn’t affect anyone outside the EU, there are other elements in the next big update that are useful to all. When Apple releases iOS 17.4, in time for the deadline of March 6, it will have a slew of other features that are worth knowing about. Top of the list is an update to Stolen Device Protection, refining it so that the automatic security delay which currently kicks in when you’re away from a familiar location can be invoked in two different ways. One is the current “Away from Familiar Locations” setting, but you can also choose “Always” so a delay is always required to change security settings. But there are other changes coming your way in iOS 17.4 and it looks like being a huge update. There are new emoji, including a succulent slice of lime, a Smiley face shaking its head yes or no, a mushroom (oh, at last) a flaming phoenix and a chain that is broken in two. This last is useful for comments about the weakest link and so on, for instance. The phoenix would suit a newly resurgent career, while the lime would be good when you have to refer to, er, a lime. There are other new emoji but these are the most striking. There could be a new version of CarPlay coming in iOS 17.4, it seems, and not before time. Podcasts will transcribe spoken words into text, which will be very useful and the text can be copied. Siri will be able to respond to messages it’s reading out in multiple languages. So, when can we expect to see these glorious updates? Since Apple has said that it needs to meet the EU’s deadline of March 8, it’s going to be before then. The Monday of that week is March 4, the Tuesday, therefore is March 5. And that date is my prediction for the release of iOS 17.4. Mark your calendar now."

    "title": "iOS 17.4—Game-Changing New Move Will Transform Your iPhone Forever",
    "content": "Apple’s iOS 17.4 update will see the iPhone maker open up its app store and iOS ecosystem to outside parties for the first time ever. In a game-changing move, the iPhone maker will comply with the EU   by allowing app side-loading from March when iOS 17.4 launches, Apple said in an  . The change coming in iOS 17.4 will be welcomed by iPhone users in the EU who would like the same flexibility Google’s Android users enjoy. But Apple has warned that   and the associated changes that need to be made to iOS and its ecosystem as a result open up iPhone users to major   risks. Apple’s iOS 17.4 update will see the iPhone maker open up its app store and iOS ecosystem to outside  Many experts agree. The beauty of iOS from a security and privacy perspective is the closed ecosystem approach, which contrasts with Android’s open marketplace. Because Apple owns the hardware and software of iOS, the iPhone maker has far better control over security. From iOS 17.4, this will change for EU-based users, but Apple says it is doing all it can to keep you as safe as possible. The Digital Markets Act aims to boost competition by preventing tech giants such as Apple from acting as “gatekeepers” dominating the marketplace. From iOS 17.4 Apple is adding new options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces “including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.” It will also add a new framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces, “enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.” It addition, developers will be able to use browser engines other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences. Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. This includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area, Apple said. In the EU, Apple is also introducing new controls that “allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app—or an alternative app marketplace—as their default.” Apple said the changes coming in iOS 17.4 will be available in the EU, but what exactly does that mean, given that the UK is no longer a member? According to reports, the UK will be exempt from the changes, for now at least. In its press statement, Apple described how the new capabilities “will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.” Those 27 countries are: The EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. But the UK does have its own version of the DMA, the UK Digital Markets Bill, which is going through approval at the moment and could eventually force Apple’s hand. As you might have gathered, Apple isn’t particularly happy about the changes. And sideloading won’t be openly available,   reports. Apple is instead maintaining an element of “walled garden” by allowing only certain app stores it calls “App Marketplaces” to distribute apps. These must follow Apple’s rules and stipulations. Meanwhile, Apple will check your device is eligible for sideloading changes via a system dubbed “country”, which combines information including your Apple ID billing address, location country, region set in iOS Settings and what type of device you are using. As 9to5Mac notes, the system also checks whether the device comes from China to restrict sideloading—although it’s not clear why. You will be able to see the region of your device via a new section in the “About This iPhone” menu, with additional details about the system to become available in an as-yet-unpublished support article on Apple’s site. Other requirements under the DMA include changes to Apple’s Safari browser. While iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser as their default, Apple needs to go further to comply with EU rules. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements to ensure users know there is a choice, Apple said it is also introducing a new choice screen, which will pop up when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. “That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options,” Apple said. Apple says a more open ecosystem that comes with the DMA means it has less ability to address other risks, “including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content.” Apple says its anti-tracking feature,   will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store. “However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features—including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy—will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.” The “one golden security measure” keeping iPhones safe is the fact apps are downloaded from within Apple’s App Store ecosystem, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. “Opening this up to unchecked third parties would potentially enable threat actors to use Trojan horses and malware within apps to target devices,” he warns. Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace is more conflicted about Apple’s iOS 17.4 changes. “The closed ecosystem does initially appear that it would be more secure and less prone to malicious apps, but this isn’t always the case.” In addition, Wright concedes that there hasn’t so far been “a significant issue” with the ability to install apps from other locations in Android.” Apple said in its announcement that it is introducing new safeguards to boost security. These include   for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers and disclosures on alternative payments. It says this will “reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU.” However even with these safeguards in place, “many risks remain,” Apple said. It’s not ideal for security-conscious EU iPhone users—many of whom use Apple devices because of their secure by design credentials. From iOS 17.4, people need to be more mindful of where the apps they download are from, Moore says. “Savvy Android users have been used to this since the beginning, but now Apple users will need to do more due diligence in order to protect their devices and data.” When making purchases through third-party markets, users should be mindful that they are providing their payment information to third parties, says Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky’s GReAT. “Apple has stated that it will not be in a position to issue refunds in such cases.” When iOS 17.4 does launch, Wright thinks most people will still stick to the official app stores. “This certainly would be my recommendation for users,” he says. I agree. While the iOS 17.4 changes are a huge change for EU iPhone users, it’s still possible to keep your iPhone secure. Check all apps before downloading—including the reviews—and if you are worried, limit your downloads to Apple’s official App Store only. —"

    "title": "iOS 17.4: How The iPhone Update That Changes Everything Affects Apps Like Spotify",
    "content": "Apple is about to release a huge update for the iPhone, iOS 17.4, coming in early March. There will be  , but part of it is Apple’s desire to comply with a new EU law, the Digital Markets Act, which comes into effect in March—hence Apple’s timing with its update. It will affect all 27 countries in the EU (the U.S. is only affected by some of these changes, though that could change in the future if the U.S. government follows the EU’s lead). Apple’s response to the EU law is to open up the iPhone software to let external app marketplaces in, while simultaneously trying to keep the iPhone safe from malware and other security issues. But some app developers are up in arms—like Spotify, which called the changes “extortion.” Where does the truth lie? The App Store on the iPhone is about to change.  Under the current arrangements, developers pay a commission to Apple when they charge for their apps or users buy digital goods or services through the app. The DMA was partly prompted by complaints from companies like Spotify, which filed   against Apple in 2019, calling the commission a tax. After Apple announced its new rules, Spotify described them as extortion. Apple responded in a statement: “We’re happy to support the success of all developers—including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice—with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.” Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify. A little background: Spotify stopped accepting premium subscriptions in the app in 2016 to avoid paying commission to Apple. And  , it switched any customers who had signed up for the premium tier to the free, ad-supported service, inviting them to sign up again using a different payment method outside the app. This means that right now, Spotify is not paying anything to Apple for placing the app in the iPhone App Store. Developers of free apps pay nothing to Apple to have their titles in the App Store. Since there are 1 billion iPhones out there, it’s a clever way to reach a huge audience. The market for streaming services is huge and growing fast, with Spotify the leading player. The changes required in the DMA are certainly complex—you can read details of them  . But where it most affects companies like Spotify is in something called the Core Technology Fee. The new rules mean that in the EU there will be options for alternative app marketplaces. These marketplaces can choose to use alternative payment methods. They won’t pay commission from the sales to Apple, but they will pay the CTF ($0.54, 0.5€). That fee is paid on the first annual install, after the app crosses the threshold of 1 million. If your app gets 999,999 installs, you pay nothing, if it’s 1,000,001 downloads in a year, the total owed to Apple is 0.5€. So, what’s the fuss about? Well, if you have 200 million downloads (Spotify’s subscriber number is higher than that), you are suddenly paying very significant sums. If Spotify decides to stick with the current terms, it will continue to pay nothing. But, understandably, it wants to offer its subscribers the most appealing way to switch to premium by signing up and paying in the app. To do that, it needs to pay the commission Apple requires under the current terms or else pay the CTF under the new terms, for example. Apple’s North Star, it says, is the privacy and security of users’ experience. The App Store is very safe, and keeping it that way is not cost-free to Apple. Apple’s view may be that developers like Spotify want access to the huge iPhone audience without recognizing or paying for the value that it brings."

    "content": "Early Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra smartphones are suffering from an annoying display issue. Samsung’s new Galaxy S24 Ultra has received   from reviewers, but some early customers are less than happy with one key aspect of the new flagship smartphone—the display. According to multiple  , several users have discovered that colors displayed on their new Galaxy S24 Ultras look considerably worse than those on previous Samsung flagships, such as last year’s Galaxy S23 Ultra. Complaints include a “dull” notification area and “awful” colors on the home screen and app drawer. A similar list of complaints compiled by Samsung insider   reveals a long list of related issues, including negative comments such as, “What I can say with confidence is that my S23U looks much, much better “ and “Screen is so dull that I switched back to my S23U.” Early speculation blamed Samsung’s new anti-reflective Corning Gorilla Glass Armor screen coating for the reduction in picture quality—a potentially disastrous situation for Samsung as it would mean nothing could be done to rectify the situation for existing smartphones. However, keen observers noted that the issue is, in fact, the result of an easily fixable software bug—and Samsung is already on the case. The bug is triggered when selecting the smartphone’s Vivid display color mode. Vivid mode typically provides punchy, saturated colors at the expense of color accuracy. Many users prefer this setting over the comparatively muted Natural mode, which offers more true-to-life results. However, Vivid mode isn’t working as intended for some Galaxy S24 Ultra users, leaving them stuck in the muted Natural color mode. For these users, switching from Natural to Vivid settings results in no visible color changes, as YouTube channel NL Tech   in a recent upload. Thankfully, according to one commenter, Samsung is aware of the problem and is already working on a fix, as shown in the provided   from Samsung’s Chat Support, which states: “No worries, our Samsung developer team is currently working now to fix this issue on your device. Rest assured that this coming software update will fix our problem on our Samsung S24.” However, it’s important to note that media playback remains unaffected by the bug, so you can watch video and enjoy games using the full color capabilities of Samsung’s latest display while waiting for the bug to be fixed. The phone’s hardware isn’t faulty. Samsung hasn’t provided a timeline for the fix, but given the relatively trivial nature of the problem, I would expect one to roll out very soon. I have reached out to Samsung directly for comment and will update this story when I receive a response. Despite the opinions of the dissatisfied owners above, Dxomark has today  ’s display as the number one performer, scoring 155 points—a single point ahead of the Google Pixel 8 Pro. Dxomark’s report praised the new flagship’s high peak brightness and, more interestingly, claims that the display’s new anti-reflective glass improves contrast and makes images more vivid rather than reducing quality as was once suspected. Most important, however, is Dxomark’s appraisal of the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s color reproduction, which was measured to be superior to that of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Furthermore, the report includes example images showing the Galaxy S24 Ultra clearly outperforming the Galaxy S23 Ultra, Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, and Google Pixel 8 Pro in terms of contrast under various lighting conditions. The Pixel 8 Pro remains best overall in terms of color fidelity, according to Dxomark. Dxomark's display tests ranked the Galaxy S24 Ultra No.1 with superior color reproduction to the  Where, then, does this leave our unhappy Vivid mode users? Much of Dxomark’s overall display score comes from factors unrelated to the issue at hand, such as touch response, motion reproduction and video quality. Video quality, in particular, was never a problem, even for those with the reported Vivid mode issue.  also focus on color accuracy rather than eye-catching (but technically inaccurate) vividness, so it’s entirely possible for the “best” smartphone display to perform subjectively “worse” for users who prefer to see boosted colors on the home screen. Dxomark has confirmed to me that testing was conducted in Vivid mode (the default setting for the Galaxy S24 Ultra). If the “bugged” Vivid mode turns out to be more accurate than intended, this could work in the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s favor when being evaluated for accuracy. However, there’s no evidence that this has happened during Dxomark’s benchmark tests. However, this doesn’t negate the need for the problem to be addressed, as Vivid mode seems not to be delivering the colors many users expect despite the stellar capabilities of the Galaxy S23 Ultra’s display. Feb 2 update—S An official response from a Samsung Community Manager spells disappointment for those Galaxy S24-series users who remain unhappy with the “washed out” colors on their home screens. Commenting on a Samsung Community thread titled  , the admin user SamsungJustin  :  along with a link to Samsung’s   for Galaxy devices. The response goes on to say: Samsung responds to the Galaxy S24-series Vivid mode display color issue. This official response makes it clear that Samsung is paying attention to user complaints. However, it offers no solution beyond adjusting the very settings that users complain aren’t currently working as desired, namely switching between Natural and Vivid modes. Furthermore, SamsungJustin’s message has been marked as the solution to the problem, leaving the whole thread marked as solved without offering a method to achieve the color reproduction many users still want. It should be noted that several users in the same forum have learned to adapt to the Galaxy S24-series colors, some now preferring its comparatively “muted” appearance. However, many remain dissatisfied, claiming to have already returned their devices. Whether Samsung will respond to feedback and issue an update to fix the problem with Vivid mode remains to be seen. The support thread, just one of many ( , , ), currently stands at 141 pages long. An email from Samsung's Spanish PR agency, seen by Spanish website , states that changes to the Galaxy S24-series color reproduction are intentional and not a bug. The message reads (machine translated from Spanish): While providing more accurate and comfortable viewing experience is to be commended, many users still prefer vivid colors over accurate ones. It remains to be seen whether Samsung will consider these complaints significant to warrant providing a new, more vivid, Vivid mode in a future update. Follow   on Instagram"

    "title": "Trump’s 2024 Legal Cases: Here’s When The Ex-President Could Go To Trial This Year—As Jack Smith’s Election Case Gets Delayed",
    "content": "Pending legal cases against Former President Donald Trump are expected to come to a head this year, as the ex-president faces the possibility of four criminal trials alongside multiple civil cases—though the ex-president’s federal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election has already been delayed, and it’s unclear how many cases will go to trial before voters go to the polls. Former President Donald Trump gestures as he wraps up a campaign event on December 19 in Waterloo,  Trump’s January was already filled with a number of court appearances, as closing arguments took place in the   against him and his company, and he went to trial against writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against him—resulting in a jury   Trump to pay her $83.3 million. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear   in Trump’s challenge of a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that disqualified him from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, which stands to have ramifications nationwide as voters in numerous other states also try to kick Trump off the ballot. Trump was scheduled to go to trial in the   against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, brought by special counsel Jack Smith—but the case has gotten delayed waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges, and it was   from the court’s calendar, with presiding Judge Tanya Chutkan now scheduled to oversee other trials starting on March 18 and April 2. Trial is scheduled to start in the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal case against Trump in state court, which   him of falsifying business records in conjunction with “hush-money” payments made to women during his 2016 campaign—and is so far expected to proceed as scheduled. Trump is slated to go to trial in the federal   against him for allegedly mishandling White House documents that he brought back to Mar-A-Lago, though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March, and the judge has already   several deadlines, which likely makes it harder for the trial to proceed on time. Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney Fani Willis has   this as the trial start date in her   against Trump and his allies for trying to overturn the 2020 election—but it’s unclear whether it actually will be, as no final trial dates have yet been set. The cases against Trump carry the possibility of significant penalties against the former president, including prison time. Trump could be sentenced to up to   in prison if he were convicted of every criminal count against him and given the maximum punishment, though that’s unlikely to happen. He could also be fined up to   in the criminal cases against him, plus whatever damages he’s ordered to pay in civil cases. The ex-president also faces more legal challenges in which a trial date hasn’t been set yet, with civil lawsuits   from Capitol police officers and Democratic lawmakers that seek to hold Trump liable for Jan. 6 and lawsuits still pending across the country that challenge Trump’s candidacy under the 14th Amendment. How the pending cases will affect the 2024 election. It’s still hard to say how the Supreme Court could rule on the 14th Amendment issue—and whether their ruling would only affect Colorado or other states—and it’s still hard to predict how many of Trump’s criminal cases will be decided before either the presidential primary wraps up this summer or the November general election. The federal election case can only move forward once the federal appeals court rules on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges—though once it does, the trial is expected to be further delayed by Trump appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court. Trump has tried to delay the trials against him until after the 2024 election, particularly given that in the federal cases against him, getting reelected would mean he could appoint prosecutors willing to drop the charges against him. Even if Trump does get convicted before the election, it still wouldn’t necessarily thwart his chances of becoming president, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from being in the White House—though recent   suggests swing voters could be dissuaded from voting for him. Trump has strongly denied the charges and civil allegations against him, pleading not guilty to the criminal charges against him and declaring cases against him to be a “witch hunt” designed to harm his presidential candidacy. The ex-president has also continued to push false claims of election fraud despite facing repercussions for trying to overturn the 2020 election,   on Truth Social in January he “did nothing wrong” and was “bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without question, Rigged and Stolen.” 56%. That’s the share of U.S. adults who believe Trump is “probably guilty” of a criminal conspiracy stemming from his false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland   released in January. That includes 88% of Democrats but only 18% of Republicans. A smaller 46% believe Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack should disqualify him from the presidency, as the 14th Amendment cases against him argue. Trump faces 91 total criminal charges in the four criminal cases against him, which were all brought in 2023 as yearslong investigations into the ex-president wrapped up and ended with indictments. Trump’s pending legal cases come after the ex-president already began to face legal consequences in 2023, including being found liable for defaming and   Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. Though he hasn’t issued his final verdict yet in Trump’s civil fraud trial, New York Judge Arthur Engoron also ruled ahead of the trial that Trump and his co-defendants—including his sons—are   because they misstating the value of their assets on financial documents, which the state alleges was done to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. Engoron ordered Trump’s business certificates to be canceled as part of that ruling, though an appeals court has put that on hold while the order gets appealed.

The bitcoin price crashed back toward $40,000 per bitcoin despite BlackRock's  legendary chief executive  . Now,  , bitcoin and crypto traders are nervously eyeing outflows from Grayscale's bitcoin trust (GBTC), freshly converted into a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF—with JPMorgan warning $1.5 billion could still be yanked from the fund in coming weeks. — The bitcoin price has swung wildly since the approval of a raft of spot bitcoin ETFs, crashing back  \"Bitcoin looks mad heavy,\" Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto derivatives pioneer Bitmex who is now the chief investment officer of a fund called Maelstrom,   to X. \"I think we break $40,000 [per bitcoin], Hayes predicted, adding he sees the bitcoin price continuing to fall through until January 31 when there's a U.S. Treasury quarterly funding announcement. The bitcoin price—along with the price of ethereum, XRP and solana—have come under pressure in part due to fears outflows from Grayscale's flagship GBTC could accelerate. \"If the previous $3 billion estimate proves correct and given $1.5 billion has exited already, then there could be an additional $1.5 billion still to exit the bitcoin space via profit-taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note   by  . The value of Grayscale's GBTC has rocketed along with rising expectations it would be granted full spot bitcoin ETF status by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in recent months. Those that have bought into GBTC over that last few years are now \"taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" JPMorgan analysts said. \"Liquidity and market depth also matter, but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity,\" the analysts wrote, finding GBTC could see a further $5 billion to $10 billion of outflows if it loses its liquidity advantage. A fee war has broken out among spot bitcoin ETF issuers, with the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity offering rock-bottom fees for those who want to buy shares, driving demand for alternatives to Grayscale's GBTC. \"At the time of conversion, GBTC held approximately 620,000 bitcoin, which has now reduced to roughly 552,000 bitcoin,\" Matteo Greco, research analyst at investment company Fineqia International, said in emailed comments. \"The strong outflow can be attributed mainly to two factors: firstly, GBTC customers were restricted from redeeming shares and could only sell them on the secondary market due to the product's structure, before the conversion. This compelled many customers to hold their positions for years without an exit option unless they were willing to sell at a significant discount in the secondary market. Secondly, the higher management fee set by Grayscale (1.5%) compared to most competitors (0.2%/0.3%) led some investors to withdraw their investment from Grayscale, either to cash in profits or reinvest in more cost-effective ETFs.\" The bitcoin price has swung wildly in recent months as spot bitcoin ETF hype pushes up bitcoin,  However, despite the wild swings hitting the bitcoin price and the weighing on the price of other major cryptocurrencies ethereum, XRP and solana, many working in the crypto space remain upbeat. \"While the short-term impact [of the spot bitcoin ETF approval] is unclear and may cause volatility over the medium term, my personal view is that the increased access for retail investors, and alignment from institutions to adopt and promote a new asset class, is certainly positive,\" Jason Lau, chief innovation officer at the OKX exchange, said in emailed comments. \"I believe that the widespread acceptance of bitcoin will ultimately drive more users to interact with bitcoin itself and benefit from the power of a decentralized, permission-less network.\""

    "content": "Shares of Meta and Amazon skyrocketed Friday to multiyear highs after the technology giants each reported blowout earnings, capping the firms’ dramatic recoveries from their 2022 nadirs as some of their big tech stock peers have been relegated to the sidelines.  Mark Zuckerberg is billions of dollars richer after his company reported strong earnings. Meta stock jumped more than 20% to a new record closing share price of $474.99 on Friday, notching its largest single-day gain since July 2013 as investors digested the social media company’s Thursday afternoon earnings report featuring revenue and profit beats and debuting the company’s first-ever cash dividend payments to shareholders. Amazon’s comparatively meager 8% jump to over $170, its highest split-adjusted price since December 2021, came after it reported similarly strong quarterly results and provided guidance above expectations. Shares of Meta and Amazon are now 31% and 12% year-to-date, respectively, according to FactSet. Meta and Amazon’s billionaire founders grew far richer Friday as their respective companies’ stocks swelled. Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos’ net worth grew $12 billion to $194 billion, according to  , placing him just $5 billion behind Elon Musk for the mantle of the richest American. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune jumped $28 billion to $167 billion, vaulting him past Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to become the world’s fourth-richest person. It wasn’t all sunshine for big tech stocks Friday. Shares of Apple sank 2% after the company’s own earnings report Thursday failed to impress Wall Street due in large part to weak sales in China, extending the iPhone maker’s year-to-date stock losses to 4%. Apple’s “sluggish growth” compared to its big tech peers is weighing on its stock price in the near term, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi explained in a note to clients. Also declining Friday were shares of Google parent Alphabet (down 2%) and Tesla (down 3%), signifying the split in the “magnificent seven” stocks who drove 2023’s broad market gains. Among those seven leading stocks, Nvidia (up 34%), Meta (up 31%), Amazon (up 12%) and Microsoft (up 9%) have gained year-to-date, while Alphabet (down 1%), Apple (down 5%) and Tesla (down 26%) have slid.

Vince McMahon. Federal prosecutors in New York have been in contact with those who've accused McMahon of sexual misconduct for months, the Journal   citing \"people familiar with the investigation,\" as part of a probe that started almost two years ago and has included a grand jury subpoena and search warrant for his phone. The subpoena also reportedly sought information from a number of people who’ve accused McMahon of misconduct ranging from sexual harassment to assault, sexual coercion and rape. Federal prosecutors have not charged McMahon or formally accused him of a crime yet.McMahon has denied some of the claims,   from former WWE referee Rita Chatterton, but has not addressed the allegations by the other women, according to the Journal. McMahon, who   from his role as CEO of the WWE parent TKO Group last week amid a new lawsuit claiming he sexually abused and trafficked former WWE employee Janel Grant, told WSJ the federal probe will not find any wrongdoing. Representatives for WWE and the TKO Group did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment Friday. Grant, who said she was offered $3 million to keep her alleged relationship with McMahon quiet, filed a lawsuit in Connecticut last Thursday alleging he pushed her to have a sexual relationship with him and shared explicit photos of her with fellow employees and wrestlers.

    "title": "House GOP Subpoenas Fulton County DA Fani Willis Amid Trump Criminal Case",
    "content": "The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani Willis on Friday, over allegations Willis’ office planned to misuse federal funds and fired a whistleblower—as the Fulton County prosecutor faces scrutiny after bringing racketeering charges against former President Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the   demanding documents from Willis’ office, citing a whistleblower allegation that Willis’ office “planned to use” a nearly $500,000 federal grant earmarked for a youth empowerment and gang prevention program to instead “cover frivolous, unrelated expenses.” The allegations are unrelated to Willis’ criminal case against Trump, which accuses the former president of illegally trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Jordan claimed in a letter to Willis that the district attorney failed to comply with multiple House committee requests for documents on her use of federal grant money, though Willis’ office has   those, arguing in a letter last fall that the requests are an unconstitutional “Attempt to Interfere” with state criminal cases. The subpoena comes as Willis faces allegations she used federal grant funding for MacBooks, other “swag” and “travel,” and that her office fired an employee who had attempted to prevent the office from allegedly misusing federal grant funding, the right-wing   reported. Willis criticized the allegations against her as “false,” claiming the employee was “terminated for cause” and that the grant funding has been “focused on helping at-risk youth and seeking justice for sexual assault victims.” Willis has been ensnared in a separate divorce case involving one of her lead Trump prosecutors for several weeks, as well as in a case brought by one of Trump’s 18 co-defendants accusing her of violating conflict of interest laws. In a court filing last month, Trump co-defendant Mike Roman alleged Willis violated ethical standards by engaging in a clandestine relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to the Trump case.   presented in the divorce case revealed Wade and Willis took trips together to the Caribbean and Napa Valley in 2022 and 2023, which Wade paid for. Willis has not denied the relationship with Wade, though she has rebuffed a separate subpoena in the divorce case,   in a court filing that Wade’s wife, Joycelyn Wade, had been “obstructing and interfering” with Trump’s RICO case in an attempt to damage her reputation. Willis reportedly plans to argue she has not broken any laws requiring her to step down from the case, sources told   on Thursday. Willis was   earlier this week to testify at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on whether she should be removed from the racketeering case for allegedly violating conflict of interest laws. Georgia Republicans, meanwhile, have launched a state   into Willis over the allegations, while multiple state GOP members have called for Willis to be  . Trump was indicted last August on   in Fulton County, including charges of racketeering, solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, over his alleged role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election—Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied any wrongdoing. Still, Willis has faced wide-ranging GOP backlash after she   against Trump, with Trump labeling the case a “witch hunt” and state Republican lawmakers calling to convene a legislative session last year to remove Willis from office—Republican Gov. Brian Kemp   that bid. The House Judiciary Committee   into Willis’ office in August on claims her office used federal funds or coordinated with federal prosecutors in her office’s prosecution of Trump and his 18 co-defendants—Jordan then sent Willis a letter weeks later asking for information.

Apple doesn’t give much detail about what’s fixed in iOS 17.3, to allow as many iPhone users as possible to update their devices before more attackers can get hold of the details. Tracked as CVE-2024-23222, the already-exploited issue in iOS 17.3 is a vulnerability in  , the engine that underpins Apple’s Safari browser, that could allow an attacker to execute code. “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited,” the iPhone maker said on its  . Apple's iOS 17.3 fixes 16 security issues, one of which is already being used in real life attacks.  Apple also fixed three more WebKit flaws as part of the iOS 17.3 security upgrade, two of which could lead to code execution. Another iOS 17.3 fix worth noting is a Kernel flaw tracked as CVE-2024-23208, which could allow an adversary to execute arbitrary code with Kernel privileges via an app. The iOS 17.3 security fixes come after Apple has issued several  , some of which patch flaws being used in  . These see adversaries compromise iPhones via so-called “zero-click” attacks requiring no interaction from the user, often utilising flaws in WebKit. It is unusual for Apple to include an urgent fix—ie one that’s already being used in attacks—as part of a major point upgrade such as iOS 17.3. This could be due to a number of things, but it’s probably just coincidental timing. Apple’s iOS 17.3 update is a big upgrade for features too, with Apple finally releasing   to prevent thieves from accessing your data if they manage to get hold of your device. The security fixes alone make updating to iOS 17.3 a no-brainer, especially if you own a device that can run iOS 17. That’s because Apple no longer supports newer devices with iOS 16 security updates. Apple has also issued other updates alongside iOS 17.3 for users of older iPhones. First up is  , a security-only update for iPhone users whose devices can’t upgrade to iOS 17.3—the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation. The iOS 16.7.5 update fixes eight security issues, one of which is the WebKit flaw tracked as CVE-2024-23222 also patched in iOS 17.3, which Apple said is already being used in attacks. The update fixes a further three WebKit issues, as well as vulnerabilities in Safari, ImageIO, Apple Neural Engine and Accessibility. Meanwhile, if your iPhone is really old—listed by Apple as the iPhone 6s, iPhone 7, iPhone SE, iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th generation), and iPod touch (7th generation)—Apple has released iOS 15.8.1 and iPadOS 15.8.1. The iPhone update fixes two WebKit security issues—both already being used in attacks. Tracked as CVE-2023-42916, the first flaw could see a user disclose sensitive information if they process malicious web content. Tracked as CVE-2023-42917, the second issue could result in arbitrary code execution. In both cases, Apple said it “is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 16.7.1.” The vulnerabilities fixed in iOS 15.8.1 were reported to Apple by Clément Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group, which often discovers iPhone attacks ulitising spyware. It goes without saying that if you own an older iPhone, you should make sure you update now to the latest software. The flaws fixed in iOS 17.3 are serious and the fact the WebKit issue is already being exploited makes the update particularly urgent. Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace warns that the Kernel-based vulnerability could “be chained with the WebKit vulnerabilities” to allow an attacker to gain control of their victim’s device remotely. So you know what to do. Go to your iPhone’s Settings > General > Software Update and download and install iOS 17.3 now. —"

The indicator, calculated by comparing how positive or negative Twitter conversations involving the digital currency are in the short-term (the last 50 days) compared to the long-term (the last 200 days), reached this point today. The chart below shows this development, along with how long-term sentiment has changed over the last several months. This graph depicts fluctuations in long-term sentiment.  While the horizontal axis displays time, the vertical axis shows both the price of bitcoin and the value or “score” of the indicator. Any score above 50 reveals that conversations have been more positive in the short-term than the long-term. Alternatively, a score below 50 points to Twitter conversations that have been less positive over the last 50 days than in the previous 200 days. Recently, the value of this indicator surpassed 90, signaling that sentiment has been significantly more optimistic in the short-term when compared to the long-term. The chart below, which depicts how long-term sentiment has fluctuated over the last several years, helps provide a better sense of the relationship that this measure has with bitcoin prices. It is worth noting that when looking at this indicator’s movements over the long-term, it reached its greatest value right around the time bitcoin prices were trading at an all-time high.

    "title": "Lebanon's Economic Rebirth Through Bitcoin",
    "content": "TOPSHOT - Lebanese demonstrators wave national flags during a demonstration on the sixth day of  According to the  , the situation in Lebanon is regarded as one of the \"most severe global crises since the mid-nineteenth century.\" This has arisen from three decades of imprudent fiscal and monetary policies, leading to the currency's decline by over 95 percent of its value before this downturn. The currency is in a state of collapse, corruption is widespread, and the banking sector is in turmoil. Samar Hawa of   has seen how these challenges have pushed the Lebanese people into difficulty. Reflecting on the nation's resilience, Samar notes, \"The Lebanese, like a Phoenix, rise from the ashes. It's beautiful but sad.\" This sentiment resonates with the mission of Rebirth Beirut, an initiative committed to supporting Lebanon in its time of economic crisis and societal rebuilding. The Lebanese Pound, also known as the Lebanese Lira, has undergone an devastating depreciation, leaving citizens like Samar contending with the erosion of their life savings. As of October 17, 2019, even USD deposits were not spared and transformed into what locals have termed 'Lollars,' a phrase coined by a Lebanese economist. This meant that in practical terms, having $100 in the bank equated to being able to use it as only $10, highlighting the stark devaluation and financial reality facing the country. This situation not only underscores the crippling financial crisis but also serves as a glaring example of third-party risk, as banks faced insolvency after a bank run. It exposes the hazards associated with centralized policymaking that may not always align with the best interests of the people. Despite four years of chaos, Lebanon still lacks a capital control law and effective crisis management measures. In contrast, bitcoin offers a clear alternative with its core principles of self-custody, empowering individuals to access their funds without the need for external permission. Its transparency mitigates the risk of arbitrary policies that could devalue currency, and its immutable and reliable consensus mechanism ensures a decentralized and secure financial system, eliminating the vulnerabilities of a single point of failure and significantly reducing the likelihood of fraud. Photo by Keystone The Lebanese economy, often swayed by political shifts, faced a shock in 2019. The government's proposal to hike taxes on essential services sparked nationwide protests. In response, the banks shut, trapping people's funds and leaving many, except for the few very influential people, mainly the bank owners and the \"Tier 1\" politicians, unable to access their savings. This event led to a significant devaluation of bank deposits, with people's savings losing a considerable portion of their value overnight, plunging the economy towards collapse. The  , which was at 1,500 LBP per dollar in October 2019, had devalued to 141,000 LBP per dollar in March 2023 and stands at around 89,000 LBP per dollar today, witnessing an overall devaluation of approximately 98.5%. For the first time in Lebanon's history, the country defaulted on its debt in March 2020. This was followed by the devastating   on August 4, 2020, which further plunged the country into social and economic distress. Lebanon's public sector, riddled with corruption, has been unable to provide even the most basic services, including proper healthcare, retirement plans, 24-hour electricity, drinkable water - people install large water containers to stock water for times when it is not provided by the government - maintenance of infrastructure, proper waste disposal, and more. Yet, in this darkness, bitcoin offers an interesting use case. Georges Haddad, previously working in Investment Management in Canada, returned to Lebanon following the financial collapse to help rebuild his country and started  , a seed phrase storage solution company that highlights the benefits of self-custody. He sees bitcoin as a solution, \"The moment you start understanding bitcoin, you see how broken money is. It's broken everywhere,\" he states. \"Lebanon, with its deep economic scars, is a testament to the fragility of fiat currencies.\" Many Lebanese remain unbanked or have faced forced de-banking due to the financial crisis. Bitcoin  also addresses the challenge of hoarding cash at home. Those with surplus income and savings have lost trust in the banking system and often need help opening foreign bank accounts due to international regulations. Bitcoin is a hedge against rampant inflation, which has plagued Lebanon in recent years with staggering estimates. It provides a means to circumvent illicit capital controls and restrictions imposed by the banking sector. In this context, stablecoins are used as an interim measure, offering easy access to dollar, serving as a stepping stone amid the crisis. Rebirth Beirut, an initiative born from the rubble, have recently started receiving bitcoin   to help fund their initiatives. These donations help fund projects such as installing cables from private generators to light up the streets. Georges draws parallels between Lebanon's collapse and the potential downfall of larger economies globally, albeit at a slower pace. \"Lebanon could only be five to ten years ahead. It can happen in a blink of an eye,\" he warns. In the past, Lebanon's banking sector was considered a pillar of economic stability, the \"Switzerland of the Middle East.\" But years of mismanagement and corruption have eroded that trust. This combination of pictures created on June 29, 2020 shows the black market rate, as calculated by  This crisis, while unique in its specifics, is symptomatic of a global issue with fiat currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, offers an alternative. Georges envisions a future where bitcoin doesn't just operate as a currency but as a wake-up call to the perils of unchecked money printing and centralization. Georges believes Lebanese expatriates will play an important role due to them being responsible for a large portion of the nation's remittance inflows. With $6 billion a year sent home, bitcoin’s low fees and fast transaction times present an attractive alternative to traditional banking. Lebanon's case is ripe for bitcoin adoption, driven by expatriates and a general distrust of centralized authorities. The country's rich and largely unexploited energy resources – sun, wind, hydro, and potentially gas – offer fertile ground for bitcoin mining. This industry could bring much-needed stability, wealth, and potentially contribute to the decades-long electricity problem. Samar and Georges share a cautious optimism for their homeland. The path forward is fraught with challenges, but the promise of bitcoin and the spirit of the Lebanese people hold the key to a rebirth. \"I am hopeful as a person.\" says Samar, \"While the road ahead presents challenges, I am encouraged by the efforts of   and the private sector which not only contribute to the restoration of infrastructure but also revive hope. This foundation of resilience and innovation instills optimism in me regarding the future.\" In Lebanon's struggle, bitcoin is more than a financial asset; it's a symbol of change, a testament to the power of innovation, and perhaps the country's first step towards a future where the currency is as resilient as its people."

This is why unions are pushing rules and laws that will throttle the gig economy and force workers to go onto traditional company payrolls. The Biden White House has just enacted a rule to do just that. Looking at how a similar effort has fared in California, this segment of What’s Ahead makes the case why this rule must be squashed.

    "title": "iOS 17.4 Release Date: Apple’s Best New iPhone Feature To Be Upgraded In Weeks",
    "content": "If you’ve updated to the latest iPhone software, iOS 17.3, you’ll know that the key new feature was Stolen Device Protection, so if someone steals your iPhone, heaven forbid, and knows your passcode, their ability to get into your digital life or remove you from your phone, is significantly curtailed. Now it’s emerged that an upgrade is on its way pronto. Apple releases iOS 17.3. The next update is already almost here. As you may know, Apple is releasing an update to its iPhone software in time to meet a deadline from the European Union so it can comply with the Digital Markets Act. While that doesn’t affect anyone outside the EU, there are other elements in the next big update that are useful to all. When Apple releases iOS 17.4, in time for the deadline of March 6, it will have a slew of other features that are worth knowing about. Top of the list is an update to Stolen Device Protection, refining it so that the automatic security delay which currently kicks in when you’re away from a familiar location can be invoked in two different ways. One is the current “Away from Familiar Locations” setting, but you can also choose “Always” so a delay is always required to change security settings. But there are other changes coming your way in iOS 17.4 and it looks like being a huge update. There are new emoji, including a succulent slice of lime, a Smiley face shaking its head yes or no, a mushroom (oh, at last) a flaming phoenix and a chain that is broken in two. This last is useful for comments about the weakest link and so on, for instance. The phoenix would suit a newly resurgent career, while the lime would be good when you have to refer to, er, a lime. There are other new emoji but these are the most striking. There could be a new version of CarPlay coming in iOS 17.4, it seems, and not before time. Podcasts will transcribe spoken words into text, which will be very useful and the text can be copied. Siri will be able to respond to messages it’s reading out in multiple languages. So, when can we expect to see these glorious updates? Since Apple has said that it needs to meet the EU’s deadline of March 8, it’s going to be before then. The Monday of that week is March 4, the Tuesday, therefore is March 5. And that date is my prediction for the release of iOS 17.4. Mark your calendar now."

    "content": "Samsung's Galaxy S24 series is first to support Ultra HDR photography on Instagram and Snapchat, but  Samsung’s recent Galaxy S24 series is the first to support the capture and display of   on social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat. However, according to a new report, similar functionality may soon become available to other Android devices. As prominent Android expert Mishaal Rahman  , Google is making it easier for Android apps to shoot Ultra HDR photos by   support to the CameraX API. This update could allow other smartphones to support the feature on social media platforms without a heavy investment in software development. Ultra HDR photography is a game-changing upgrade made available with Android 14. For the first time, it allows Android devices to capture and display photos using the full range of colors and brightness levels that the hardware can provide while maintaining compatibility with standard JPEG files. Announced in 2019, CameraX is a software library allowing developers to access Google’s advanced camera features with just a couple of lines of code. This library gives “in-app” cameras easy access to features such as Night Sight, Portrait Mode, and soon Ultra HDR, which would otherwise be available only when using a smartphone’s native camera app. Google created CameraX after discovering that over 70% of all camera usage occurred on developer-made apps rather than the device’s built-in camera app. Shooting from inside popular third-party apps would often result in reduced picture quality and missing camera features without help from the CameraX API. However, not all devices and apps use Google’s Camera APIs, so support for advanced camera features will continue to rely on support from individual manufacturers and developers. A subsequent report, also from , reveals that OnePlus’s newly launched  smartphone will be the first from the company to support Google’s CameraX and Camera2 vendor extensions. Currently, the OnePlus 12 uses Google’s extensions to provide Bokeh and Night modes on the primary rear camera and Night mode for the selfie camera. While there’s no guarantee that the new Ultra HDR CameraX extension will also be implemented, the company’s support of CameraX paves the way for support of this feature on third-party apps in the near future. If you want to check your own Android device for CameraX and Camera2 support, you can use the   app to receive a full breakdown of supported features. You can also use this app to browse a database of results captured from various different Android devices, although the interface is somewhat clunky. Follow   on Instagram"

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of sexual assault, a jury ruled Friday, ending years of litigation as Carroll has sought retribution for the former president’s attacks on her—and adding to the $5 million Trump has already been ordered to pay her. Former President Donald Trump leaves his apartment building in New York on Jan. 22, to attend his  After a brief deliberation Friday afternoon the jury returned a verdict saying Trump must pay $83.3 million in damages, including a $65 million award for punitive damages and $18.3 million in compensatory damages. Carroll first sued Trump in November 2019, accusing the then-president of defamation after he denied her allegations of sexual assault, claiming Carroll wasn’t “my type.” She filed a second lawsuit in November 2022 alleging defamation and sexual assault, which went to trial first in May 2023, with the jury ruling Trump did assault and defame Carroll—but did not rape her. Given that Trump had already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault—the second lawsuit was based on different but substantially similar comments he made about Carroll—this trial was only to determine damages, and began Jan. 16. Trump has already appealed the verdict against him in Carroll’s first trial, and could likely do the same with this ruling. He’ll still have to turn over the money first, however, as he did in the first case,   the sum into a court-controlled account while the case is being appealed. The ex-president has continued to attack Carroll on social media in recent weeks and months—posting about her   on Monday alone—though it remains to be seen if Carroll has any intention of filing another defamation claim against Trump for his more recent posts. Forbes has estimated Trump’s   at $2.6 billion as of October, with an estimated $426 million in cash and liquid assets. It’s unclear whether he’ll be drawing from those reserves for his payout to Carroll or pay through his Save America PAC, which has been handling the lion’s share of his legal fees—though that group   having only $3.7 million in cash on hand as of June 30. This may be the first of two big payments Trump will be ordered to make in cases against him this month, as Judge Arthur Engoron is also expected to imminently issue a verdict in the ex-president’s separate  . New York Attorney General Letitia James brought that case against Trump and his company, alleging the ex-president and his associates fraudulently misstated the value of assets on financial statements for personal gain. The case went to trial starting in October, and Engoron has said he’ll likely issue his verdict by the end of January. James is   Engoron to force Trump and his co-defendants to pay approximately $370 million plus interest, with the majority of that to be paid by Trump and companies he controls. Carroll first accused Trump in 2019 of sexually assaulting her decades earlier, writing in a   published by New York Magazine that he raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. After Trump attacked her and her allegations, Carroll   him for defamation in November 2019, alleging Trump’s reaction to her allegations caused her “emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.” The case got delayed in the courts for years as Carroll’s second lawsuit moved forward, as Trump unsuccessfully tried to have the first case dismissed because he was president when making the comments about her. Carroll is one of approximately   who has come forward with allegations of sexual assault or misconduct against Trump, but is the only one whose allegations have gone to trial. Former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos also sued Trump for defamation after he denied her account of sexual assault, but later   the lawsuit in Nov. 2021. Zervos’ attorney said she stood by her allegations of assault but “no longer wishes to litigate against the defendant.” Trump has denied all the claims against him and has maintained he doesn’t know and didn’t assault Carroll, though U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the most recent trial, said before the case went to trial that he could not make those claims in court, because he’s already been found liable."

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks during a news conference at the Fulton County  Willis, who has not publicly responded to the allegations, plans to argue that she has not breached any laws that would require her to step aside in the case,  , citing sources familiar with her thinking. Willis has faced intense backlash since one of Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case, Mike Roman, alleged in a January court filing she hired a lead prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade, after the two had a “clandestine” relationship, his attorneys wrote, accusing Willis of violating ethical standards and creating an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman’s attorneys did not provide direct evidence on Willis’s alleged relationship with Wade, instead citing unnamed sources, though credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for flights for her to Miami and San Francisco—which Wade’s wife   can only be explained by a “romantic relationship.” Some legal experts have expressed doubts there is legal standing to force Willis or Wade off the case, but others have suggested one or both should voluntarily remove themselves as the allegations threaten to taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions. “I’d tell her to get out of the case. I really think in this type of case with these allegations, this case is bigger than any one prosecutor,” CNN legal analyst and former Georgia US Attorney Michael Moore   the network. “And I think probably to preserve the case to show what’s most important to her is the facts of the Trump case as opposed to her political career if you will at this moment.” If Willis were to recuse herself, it could potentially delay the case and push the trial beyond the November general election, as a   would need to reassign the case. Willis has proposed an Aug. 5 trial date in the case, which charges Trump and 18 co-defendants with racketeering and other felonies related to their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Willis has not publicly responded to the allegations, outside of a statement she made before a church congregation on Jan. 14 defending Wade’s qualifications and questioning whether her adversaries were “playing the race card.” Willis was subpoenaed to testify in the divorce case before it was settled on Tuesday. Contesting the subpoena request, she accused Wade’s wife, Jocelyn Wade, of “obstructing and interfering” with the prosecution against Trump in an effort to harm her reputation. Friday is Willis’ deadline to respond to the allegations. She could also be called to testify in a Feb. 15 hearing, where both sides will present evidence. The GOP-led Georgia state legislature also voted last week to form a special committee to investigate Willis."

    "title": "Meta Earnings: Zuckerberg’s ‘Year Of Efficiency’ Nets Greatest Profits Ever",
    "content": "Meta just tallied its most profitable quarter—and year—ever, the Facebook parent revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report, an impressive feat considering the company’s 2022 beating reflected in its stock’s record run-up in recent months, though scars remain from billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s panned pivot into the “metaverse.”  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before Congress on Wednesday.  Meta’s $5.33 earnings per share during the fourth-quarter and $14.87 full-year profit per share were both the highest ever recorded by the company, beating respective analyst estimates of $4.82 and $14.81, according to FactSet. The per share profit metrics are gaudier than reality due to Meta’s massive  —the company’s 2023 net income of $39.1 billion fell short of 2021’s record $39.4 billion—but it still marks a rapid turnaround from Meta’s painful 2022, as the company’s earnings per share expanded 203% year-over-year in the three-month period ending last month. Meta’s top line growth was also strong, as full-year revenue grew 25% to a record $40.1 billion, while fourth-quarter revenue was a record $134.9 billion, compared to forecasts of $39.1 billion (digital advertising accounts for about 98% of Meta’s sales). Shares of Meta soared more than 10% shortly after the earnings report’s release as the company announced another $50 billion in stock buybacks and unveiled its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share, to be paid out March 26. Meta’s after-hours share price of about $440 implies a record market value for the company of about $1.1 trillion. Despite the dramatic recovery, Meta’s financials still include ghosts from the firm’s ugly 2021-2022 stretch when its stock fell more than 75% as Zuckerberg touted his company’s push into augmented and virtual reality. Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which encompasses its metaverse endeavors led by the Oculus headset, lost $4.6 billion last quarter, a 7% wider operating loss than Q4 2022. The augmented and virtual reality segment reported a $16.1 billion loss in 2023, worse than 2022’s $13.7 billion loss and comparing negatively to Meta’s social media arm’s $62.8 billion operating profit. Wall Street is largely buying into Zuckerberg’s vision for Meta even as cash bleeds from Reality Labs. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth explained it’d be a boon for Meta if it can “simply lose less money” on the metaverse. Bank of America’s Justin Post noted Meta’s share price to earnings ratio excluding Reality Labs is far lower than the S&P 500’s, posing an “attractive core valuation” for Meta. Both Anmuth and Post have buy ratings for Meta shares, as do 81% of the analysts tracked by FactSet. Meta’s stock has surged more than 300% since bottoming out in November 2022, outgaining every stock listed on the S&P except for artificial intelligence darling Nvidia. Meta is no slouch in AI: Its generative AI large-language model   competes with those of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google, and it   is furthering use of its own semiconductor chips to power its AI systems, a solution designed to reduce Meta’s reliance on AI chip market leader Nvidia. “AI will go across everything,” Zuckerberg   Forbes this fall. Zuckerberg is the  person in the world with a net worth of about $140 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates, thanks largely to his 13% stake in Meta."

The former president could end up paying more than $10 million in damages to writer E.

Trump   Carroll of changing her story about what happened when Trump allegedly raped Carroll in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman in the mid 1990s, saying Monday that Carroll “doesn’t know the day, month, season, year, or decade - because it did not happen.” The former president—who has already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault in a separate lawsuit also brought by Carroll—  to the second trial as a “witch hunt.” Trump is expected to take the stand to testify in the trial this week, though court was canceled Monday after a juror went home sick. Trump will not be penalized for his attacks on Carroll outside of court because there are no restrictions on his speech outside of court.

    "title": "Milli Vanilli Was Way Ahead Of Its Time, and Deserves a Second Look",
    "content": "Were the Beatles better musicians and singers than songwriters? It’s a question worth asking. As in could they have produced even more hits if they’d left the songwriting to others? John Lennon once said it all began musically with Elvis Presley, and Presley left the writing to others. Most famously, legendary Beach Boy Brian Wilson loathed touring, so much so that he sent the Beach Boys   out on the road so that he could focus all of his energies on songwriting and recording with unknown-to-the-buying-public studio musicians.  , viewed by many music experts (I know nothing about music) as one of the greatest albums of all time, was the result of Wilson outsourcing his performing to others. These anecdotes came to mind while reading Frank Farian’s   in the  . Farian was a prominent music producer for decades, but his name will always be most associated with Milli Vanilli, a two-man act that turned out to not be what so many assumed. For those who don’t know about Milli Vanilli, it was a musical duo comprised of Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan.   reporter Alex Williams described them as “telegenic performers who knew how to rock a shimmering stage costume and move their feet.” The alleged “challenge” was that neither performer was a very good singer. No problem, it turned out. As many readers are well aware, Farian had already recorded an album with studio musicians whom Farian concluded lacked “the look to beguile young MTV audiences.” Which, as musical history makes clear, can be a problem. To understand why, consider the 2013 documentary  . About the backup singers who gave life to so many well-known tunes, there was a reason these backups were always twenty feet from center stage despite their amazing voices: they lacked the charisma to be lead singers. It’s that basic. Farian once again sensed this about the musicians he produced the 1989 album   with. In which case he signed up Pilatus and Morvan to be the faces of his music. Farian’s instincts proved wildly correct.   yielded four hits, three of them #1 singles, and sold over 10 million albums. Based on the strength of the album, Milli Vanilli went out on tour. The problems began at a July of 1989 concert in Bristol, CT when the vocal track skipped over and over again as Pilatus and Morvan performed it. Then the duo won a Grammy for Best New Artist. Williams reports that the Grammy win shined too bright a light on the faces of the music, so much so that Farian confessed. As many readers remember, Milli Vanilli was disgraced. Pilatus and Morvan became a collective punchline. Eight years later Pilatus died of a heart attack. The story is very sad, and the view here is that it’s time to correct the negative perception of the musical act. Better yet, the speculation here is that in time there will be numerous musical acts that resemble Milli Vanilli. Think about it. Just as bands and individual acts have often outsourced the songwriting to songwriters, just as bands have outsourced the recording of their music to session musicians (think the Beach Boys once again, and Brian Wilson’s recording of songs with the legendary Wrecking Crew), why shouldn’t some musical acts outsource the presentation of their work to those with looks and moves that are more stage and audience friendly? Isn’t the goal of musicians to reach as many listeners as possible? What Farian, Pilatus and Morvan did just seems so logical, particularly in a world that grows more globalized by the day. Everything, from the pencil to the iPhone, is a beautiful consequence of sophisticated global cooperation, so why not music? As Farian himself later explained it about Milli Vanilli, “It was two people in the studio, and two people onstage. One part was visual, one part recorded. Such projects are an art form in themselves, and the fans were happy with the music.”  . Frank Farian wasn’t wrong, or a bad guy, or a fraud, he was just ahead of his time. So was Milli Vanilli. Give the musical act its due."

    "title": "Houston Rockets Acquire Veteran Big Man Steven Adams",
    "content": "PHOENIX, ARIZONA - JANUARY 22: Steven Adams #4 of the Memphis Grizzlies saves an out-of-bounds ball  The Houston Rockets had been rumored all season to be in search of a center to backup starter Alperen Sengun. On Thursday, they got their man. He just won’t be available to play for the Rockets until the 2024-2025 season. The Rockets sent three second round picks to the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the expiring contract of Victor Oladipo, in return for veteran center Steven Adams. Adams, 30, is on the books through just next season, when he is slated to earn $12.6 million. Stevens remains unavailable for action for the duration of the 2023-2024 season as he continues to recover from knee surgery. Apart from the draft capital, the trade allows the Grizzlies to shed Stevens’ salary from the books next season. The Rockets, on the other hand, add a physical presence to their lineup and bolster their bench heading into next season. Houston had been relying upon 37-year-old veteran forward Jeff Green to fill the backup center void for much of this season but it had become apparent that size off the bench was Houston’s greatest need. The move may indicate that Rockets brass will approach this season patiently and not look to make an aggressive move with an eye towards the play-in. At the same time, the team is still armed with the expiring contracts of Jock Landale, Jeff Green, and Jae’Sean Tate (team option), as well as draft picks owed from the Brooklyn Nets in the next several seasons, including what is looking like a lottery pick this summer. After the team chased Brook Lopez in free agency this past offseason, Sengun has entrenched himself as the team’s starter at the position, also cementing himself as the team’s first option on offense. The challenge for Rockets head coach Ime Udoka this season has been the drop off when Sengun has gone to the bench. That challenge may continue through the end of this season, but the hope is that Adams’ addition will be a solution next season. Following the trade, per Spotrac, Houston’s total cap allocation on the season is $146.4 million, still significantly below the 2023 $165.29 million luxury tax threshold. The real decisions for Rockets brass start this offseason when Sengun and third-year-guard Jalen Green both become extension eligible."

    "content": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 03: Julio Rejon, driver of the #55 NS-GGG Racing Team -JV  NASCAR moved its Clash exhibition race up a day and ran the main event Saturday instead of Sunday as was scheduled along with a NASCAR Mexico race that was also slated for Sunday. The change came due to the forecast of incoming inclement weather and what NASCAR said was out of concern for fan safety. The weather is expected to worsen overnight Saturday into Sunday with the chance of flooding and high winds. The storm is the second one in Southern California after a similar one hit the area on Thursday causing localized flooding. The National Weather Service   \"the largest storm of the season\" and is expecting the storm to have \"dangerous, even life-threatening impacts.\" Los Angeles city officials held a   warning that the second storm could be worse L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said the city will have an \"all-hands-on-deck\" plan. \"There are indications that the coming storm could be as strong as Tropical Storm Hilary was in August,\"   Bass. \"We made it through Tropical Storm Hilary, and I am confident that we will weather this storm.\" The decision to move an event up a day is an unprecedented move that hasn’t happened in NASCAR. Normally weather can delay a race, and NASCAR has moved the start time up on occasion, but moving a race up a day is not something that is usually even considered. “Certainly not ideal,” NASCAR COO Steve O’Donnell said in L.A. at the Coliseum shortly after the decision was announced. “But as the weather forecasts continued to worsen, public safety, a lot of the things that were going around, a lot of different events that are going on in the community as well. “We started to review Saturday options late last night and this morning those obviously sped up,” he added. “We really applaud the Coliseum for even making this a possibility to the best of what is a really tough situation for the fans and this racing community but felt like this was the best option to keep everybody safe and still try and get both events in.” While the race was moved to Saturday night, the possibility of rain was in the forecast meant there could have been another delay. O’Donnell said they still had a plan though safety for all was still top of mind. “Then we'll push and then we'll look at, you know, what we can do tomorrow as well,” he said. “But we're going to keep the public safety in mind, first and foremost to make sure that we have what's necessary for us to let the Coliseum to get folks in and out safely.” O’Donnell said the entire staff was aware of the city’s concerns for the safety of everyone in the community and that was factored into the decision. “We're a guest here,” he said. “The Coliseum runs events all year long, so they're the experts…They certainly supported our decision and have been great in terms of, working but they're going to be challenged too. When you look at tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday of what's available, we were cognizant of that, that’s always what we want to do is to keep first and foremost the safety of everyone in mind.” O’Donnell added that the decision to move the race up a day isn’t something NASCAR will look at doing in the future and mentioned that fans have already bought tickets and had made plans to be at the Coliseum on Sunday. “We're going to be reaching out to every single fan,” O’Donnell said. “To see what we can do to make it good on their end. But this was our best option for us to at least see some racing.” O’Donnell admitted that with refunds, and the loss of a prime-time TV spot NASCAR will take a financial loss. “It certainly hurts, it's not going to be great, right?” O’Donnell admitted. “Nor from a ratings standpoint. “But in terms of what could have been at the end of the day, it's what's the right thing to do, and what's the right thing to do to keep everyone safe and this is that decision.”"

    "content": "LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - FEBRUARY 03: (L-R) Nassourdine Imavov of Russia punches Roman Dolidze of Georgia  The UFC was back at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas for Saturday's UFC Vegas 85 fight card. In the main event, Nassourdine Imavov, who was the No. 11 fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings, scored a majority decision win over the No. 8 ranked Roman Dolidze. Meanwhile, the evening's co-headliner saw Renato Moicano return to action for the first time since November 2022 to score a unanimous decision victory over Drew Dober. Below we look at the winners and losers from the UFC Vegas 85 fight card, which streamed in its entirety on ESPN+.  Nassourdine Imavov had an excellent first round against Roman Dolidze in their UFC Vegas 85 middleweight main event. However, because of the effort he put toward finishing the fight inside the first five minutes, Imavov did not have much to offer over the next four rounds. Despite his output dipping over the last 20 minutes of the contest, Imavov did enough to get a majority decision win. Saturday’s victory will elevate Imavov standing in the UFC middleweight rankings as he entered the bout at No. 11 and Dolidze was No. 8, but it’s hard to say just how much of a jump he will make in the 185-pound rankings.  Renato Moicano did an excellent job of taking Drew Dober out of their lightweight scrap early in their UFC Vegas 85 matchup. He did this via takedowns and a heavy top game. However, Dober was able to get back into the fight following a takedown of his own in the second stanza. Then, a failed takedown attempt from Dober in the third round was the opening Moicano needed to change the tide of the scrap and give Moicano the decision to win. Moicano, who had not fought since he submitted Brad Riddell in November 2022, was the No. 13 fighter in the official UFC 155-pound rankings heading into this fight. He should be in line for a top-10 opponent in his next outing. Wow. Randy Brown snapped a double jab to the head of Muslim Salikhov and followed that with a perfectly timed and placed right hand that put his opponent down and out at the With the win, Brown has quietly moved to 6-1 in his past seven outings. His only setback during that time was a February 2023 setback to the rising Jack Della Maddalena.  Natalia Silva continued climbing the  . Silva was No. 9 on those rankings heading into her UFC Vegas 85 matchup against the No. 7 ranked Viviane Araujo. Silva, who turned 27 on fight night, used her speed and ability to mix up her striking techniques and targets to pick up the win. The rising Brazilian, who was my   on this card, struggled at some points to get off the cage when Araujo put her there, but she did enough work in the open to pick up the victory. There are still questions about how Silva will fare against well-rounded fighters with strong defensive striking and wrestling skills, but Silva has yet to face a fighter who can impose their will on her inside the Octagon. With the win, Silva, a former Jungle Fights flyweight champ, moved to 5-0 under the UFC banner. She should face a fighter inside the top five of the division in her next outing. Gilbert Urbina did his best to keep Charles Radtke as far away from him as possible. The reason for Urbina’s approach became clear when Radtke landed a perfect left hook to drop him to the mat with 45 seconds left in the round. Urbina got back to his feet, but a second left, with 15 ticks left on the clock, brought the fight to its abrupt end. With the win, Radtke moved to 2-0 in the UFC and he is now on a six-fight winning streak.  Molly McCann   before dropping to strawweight for her UFC Vegas 85 matchup against Diana Belbita. McCann looked excellent in her first UFC contest at 115 pounds. She was aggressive from the start of the fight and threw all her strikes with bad intentions. McCann used a power takedown to get the fight to the mat, and from there, she set up a nasty armbar to end the bout at 4:59 of the first round. The victory ended a two-fight losing skid for McCann. Both those defeats came via first-round submission. UFC Vegas 85 was a bounce-back performance for McCann, who was on a three-fight winning streak between September 2021 and July 2022. Charles Johnson was in deep trouble in the early going of his flyweight scrap opposite Azat Maksum at UFC Vegas 85. Maksum dropped Johnson in the first round and nearly finished him with a D’arce choke, but Johnson adjusted his style ahead of the second round, and that was all he needed to get the decision win. Johnson forced Maksum to come to him for the final 10 minutes of the contest while landing solid counter-strikes. Johnson also was close to wrapping things up with a choke against the fence late in the fight. Johnson looked excellent in the last 10 minutes of this matchup. The win ended Johnson’s three-fight losing skid.  Themba Gorimbo was aggressive in the opening moments of his fight against Pete Rodriguez, landing a powerful overhand right that put Rodriguez on the mat. The ground strikes that followed left Rodriguez looking to wrestle with referee Herb Dean, who had stepped in to end the fight at 32 seconds of the first round. The win was Gorimbo’s second career knockout victory and first since 2019 under the EFC banner. Gorimbo was a -245 favorite over Rodriguez, who was competing for the first time since he knocked out Mike Jackson in October 2022. After his stoppage win, the 33-year-old said his goal is to become the UFC welterweight champion in 2024.  Jung Gyeong Lee looked excellent in dismantling Blake Bilder at UFC Vegas 85. The 28-year-old was calm and confident throughout the fight. He took advantage of small openings, including landing a nasty knee when the two separated along the fence in the first stanza. Lee’s striking was on point throughout the fight, and his takedown defense left Bilder frustrated and ineffective. Another thing that stood out in this featherweight matchup was that Lee never overextended himself when he had Bilder hurt. He did not waste energy or time pursuing a finish that might not have been there. Lee is a fighter to watch in the 145-pound division.  Luana Carolina fought off three submission attempts in the third round of her flyweight fight opposite Julija Stoliarenko to pick up a late finish via ground strikes. With the win, Carolina moved to 4-3 in the UFC. An awkward striker with a lanky frame, Carolina is on a two-fight winning streak. Carolina came in overweight for the bout, tipping the scales at 128 pounds, which takes some shine off her victory. MarQuel Mederos looked slightly uncomfortable early in his UFC debut matchup opposite Landon Quinones. However, he quickly adjusted to his foe's offense, countering Mederos' strikes well while landing more volume in the final 10 minutes of the lightweight scrap, which was enough to give him the decision win. Mederos needs work on his offensive clinch work. He didn't have much to offer in close as far as wrestling or striking.  Roman Dolidze had little to offer in the way of offense against Nassourdine Imavov. He didn’t land more than eight significant strikes in any round and finished the fight with a total of 34 significant strikes landed. He also did not register a single takedown or submission attempt during the 25-minute scrap.  Drew Dober looked like he was on the way to a comeback win over Renato Moicano, but an ill-advised takedown attempt put him on his back halfway through the third round. That ended any hope of Dober picking up the win.  Muslim Salikhov put together a five-fight winning streak between 2018 and 2021. However, since then he has gone 1-3 with two knockout losses, including his loss to Randy Brown on Saturday night. Salikhov turns 40 in early June. His future does not look bright.  Viviane Araujo knew what she had to do to win this fight, negate the time and space Natalia Silva uses for her striking. She did that for prolonged periods of the bout, but she failed to generate any offense from in close, which cost her the fight. With the loss, Araujo fell to 1-3 in her past four outings.  Diana Belbita didn't seem fazed by Molly McCann's power and aggression in the opening moments of their UFC Vegas 85 scrap. Her game plan seemed to be to weather the early storm and then see what McCann had later in the contest. Unfortunately for Belbita, there was no later as McCann submitted her with one second left in Round 1. Azat Maksum had a fantastic first round against Charles Johnson. He dropped Johnson in the first stanza and nearly had a D’arce choke submission. However, Maksum and his team did not adjust to Johnson’s style in the final 10 minutes of the fight. That inability to change things up left Maksum with his first career defeat. Maksum has talent, so seeing how he responds to this defeat will be interesting.  Julija Stoliarenko is a specialist. Of her 11 career wins, 10 have come via armbar submission. She almost had an 11th submission victory on Saturday against Luana Carolina, but her opponent fought off those attempts and picked up a third-round TKO finish. Stoliarenko needs to become a more well-rounded fighter. Her 2-5 record in the UFC shows that her specialty is ineffective at this level. She needs to evolve her fight game.  Landon Quinones fell to 0-2 in the UFC with a decision loss to MarQuel Mederos at UFC Vegas 85. Quinones did some good work early with his striking from distance, but once his opponent figured out his timing, Quinones struggled. If Quinones had more output, the ability to take the fight to the mat, or could have landed some strikes in the clinch, he might have picked up the win in the lightweight scrap.  Thomas Petersen had a decent first round in his UFC debut, scoring a takedown and some ground control time against Jamal Pogues, but he didn’t have much to offer his foe on the feet. Petersen had opportunities to take over the fight, but his lack of offensive striking, his weak striking defense, and his lack of a backup plan hurt him in a big way. Petersen needs a lot of work if he hopes to have a long stay on the UFC roster.  Jamal Pogues was a better striker than his opponent, Thomas Petersen in their heavyweight scrap. Pogues used that striking, distance control and some takedown defense to pick up the decision win. Pogues needs to work on his conditioning, takedown defense, and ability to get back to his feet once he hits that mat. The 28-year-old heavyweight is a work in progress, and he needs to improve if he wants to get off the prelims of UFC Fight Night cards."

    "content": "Shares of Apple closed down almost 2% on Tuesday following an   from Hong Kong-based TF International Securities that said iPhone shipments will drop up to 15% year-over-year in 2024, adding Apple could experience one of the more significant declines among top phone brands this year. The Apple logo is displayed at the Apple Store June 17, 2015 on Fifth Avenue in New York City.  Apple shares closed at $188.04 on Tuesday, continuing a consistent decline the company’s stock has experienced since Jan. 24, when it closed at $194.50. Tuesday’s 1.9% drop outpaced the decline of the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which declined just shy of 0.8%. Tuesday’s drop came amid the report from TF International Securities that predicted iPhone shipments will be trimmed down to about 200 million units this year, a 15% decrease year-over-year. The report attributed the figures to a supply chain survey that indicated “Apple lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments” of key semiconductor components—electronic pieces used in devices from phones and computers to vehicles and televisions. TF International Securities also claimed smartphone maker Huawei’s return in the Chinese market, alongside rising popularity of foldable phones, will contribute to the shipment decline. A lack of “significant design changes” with new iPhone models will also harm Apple’s shipping momentum, at least until 2025 at the earliest, the report added. Apple didn’t immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. Apple will report its fourth quarter and annual earnings Thursday, with analysts expecting 0.6% revenue growth from last year to $117.9 billion, according to  .  as the most valuable public company earlier this month and continues to maintain a higher market capitalization ($3 trillion) than the iPhone maker ($2.9 trillion). Apple shares have largely increased in the past year after trading around $144 one year ago. The company’s latest smartphone, the iPhone 15, sold well at launch and managed to sell out on pre-orders. However, Apple’s other hardware divisions took notable hits recently including its MacBook computer, which experienced a 34% sales decline last quarter. Apple reported $  last quarter, performing slightly under analysts forecasts. (Forbes)"

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at CES 2024 earlier this month. Microsoft’s $62 billion of sales in the three-month period ending last month topped average analyst estimates of $61.1 billion, according to FactSet, while its $2.93 earnings per share topped forecasts of $2.77. The booming sales topped the prior quarter’s record $56.5 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase.

Microsoft’s valuation narrowly topped that of Apple, which held the mantle of world’s biggest company for a majority of the last three years until Microsoft reclaimed the throne earlier this month.

    "title": "Biden Calls Trump A ‘Loser’ In South Carolina Speech",
    "content": "President Joe Biden referred to former President Donald Trump as a “loser” during a campaign speech in Charleston Monday, the second time in a matter of days Biden has ramped up his attacks against Trump as the 2024 presidential race builds steam. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event at Emanuel AME Church on January 8, 2024 in  Biden, speaking about the 2020 presidential election, said “losers are taught to concede when they lose, and he’s a loser,” he said from Mother Emanuel AME Church, a historic Black church where a white supremacist killed nine worshippers in a mass shooting in 2015. Biden also pointed to the dozens of failed GOP-backed legal challenges to the election results, and accused election deniers of not having “respect for the 81 million people who voted” for him. The statements follow similar criticism of Trump during a rally in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on Friday to mark the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, where Biden slammed Trump for attempting to “steal history” by contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election and rebuked him for   used by Adolf Hitler to describe immigrants. Biden’s speech Monday was also interrupted by protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, to which Biden responded that he is urging the Israeli government to scale back its attacks in Gaza. “In their world, all these Americans, including you, don’t count,” Biden said Monday. “But that’s not the real world. That’s not democracy. That’s not America. In America, we all count.” The 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close rematch between Trump and Biden, who trails the former president in polls by 2 points, according to RealClearPolitics  . Biden’s approval rating stands at 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s  , and surveys increasingly show voters lack confidence in him to manage the economy and the Israel-Hamas war. His speech in South Carolina comes as he has struggled to retain support from Black voters and other key demographics. While South Carolina’s Feb. 3 Democratic primary is not competitive, it could serve as a testing ground for Biden’s ability to mobilize Black voters who helped propel him to win the White House in 2020. How a criminal conviction could impact Trump’s chances of winning the 2024 election and his slight lead over Biden in polls. While none of his four criminal cases, encompassing 91 total charges, are expected to conclude before the primaries are over, all of his cases, plus several civil suits, are scheduled to go to trial before the November general election. In addition, the Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling on whether Trump will be allowed to remain on the ballot in Maine and Colorado after both states decided he should be removed from their ballots under a 14th Amendment provision that prohibits elected officials who engaged in an insurrection from running for office again."

On Monday, a Cobb County judge ruled to unseal the Wades’ divorce records—which could give insight into Nathan Wade alleged relationship with Willis—but ruled Willis doesn’t need to be deposed in the divorce case, yet,   to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson said it appeared that “Wade would be the first and best source of information on what his income has been and how he's been spending it,” ABC News  , adding he would wait to determine whether Willis has “unique personal knowledge” and has to testify until after Wade’s deposition, which is scheduled for next week.

    "title": "Here’s Why Trump Might Sabotage Plan—Backed By Biden—To Close The Border",
    "content": "A much-anticipated crackdown on the southern border that both many Republicans and President Joe Biden support—and which Senate backers say could be voted on this week—might fail just because Donald Trump wants it to, and is pressing his supporters to vote against it. Trump’s campaign of pressure to senators and public criticism at rallies and on social media may  At a   on Saturday night, the former president continued his campaign to scuttle the deal, which he called a “monstrosity,” saying “there is zero chance I will support this horrible open border betrayal of America,” Trump told supporters on Saturday night, without clearly describing his opposition to the bill. Trump has made his ability to solve the border crisis his primary campaign message, and his only clear criticism of the bipartisan plan is that the border deal would also mean “billions of dollars to Ukraine and other countries.” Biden and House Republicans have been in a standoff for months: Biden has sought resuming support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia, while Republicans have withheld that funding until Biden commits to solving the surge in migration at the border. But Trump appears to not want Biden to notch any success—and his pressure campaign appears to be working: House Speaker Mike Johnson called any bipartisan Senate bill “likely dead on arrival” on Friday, instead   to Republican colleagues that he would continue to support the GOP’s “Secure the Border Act” which failed to get any Democratic support when it was introduced in May. In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately said he would still support the Biden-backed bill, while admitting Trump’s criticism has put Republicans in a challenging position,   reported. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the lead negotiators, told   on Sunday they were “finalizing the last pieces of text right now” and preparing to present the bill on the floor as early as next week. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), called Trump’s actions “appalling,”   that “he does not want us to solve the problem at the border, he wants us to lay the blame of the border at Biden—and the idea that someone running for president would say ‘please hurt the country so I can blame my opponent and help my politics’ is a shocking moment.” “I notice a lot of the Senators… they’re blaming it on me,” Trump said at his   on Saturday. “I said ‘that’s ok, please blame it on me, please.’” 2.4 million. That’s the number of total migrant encounters recorded at the southern border by Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, according to Republicans on the House  . At his rally on Saturday, Trump claimed “two million illegals crossed the border every single year in the past, and now that number’s changing to maybe eight times that amount,” but the data presented by the committee states that agents only encountered about 3.2 million total migrants across the country last year. On Sunday morning, House Republicans unveiled the text of two new   against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which they plan to introduce to the House Homeland Security Committee next week. Mayorkas has faced   from congressional Republicans for his handling of the border, and faced two impeachment hearings earlier this month. The newly released articles accuse Mayorkas of violating his oath of office by “willfully refus[ing] to comply with numerous detention requirements spelled out by the Immigration and Nationality Act.” The White House has maintained that there is no compelling case against Mayorkas. The DHS also circulated a   criticizing the articles of impeachment, accusing Republicans of “ignor[ing] the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas.” The articles are expected to vote along party lines and advance the articles to a full House vote on Tuesday,   reported. In a rare move on Friday, President Biden   of the bipartisan deal to pass sweeping immigration reform measures, allowing the Department of Homeland Security to close the southern border after they encounter a daily average of more than 4,000 migrants over the course of a week. The bill also provides funding for thousands of more border patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges to handle the ongoing surge, as well as 100 “cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl,” according to the White House. However, many specific details of the bill have not yet been released, including any amount of aid promised for Ukraine should the bill pass. Biden has called thebill a “win for America.”"

    "title": "Trump Calls Central Bank Digital Currency ‘Very Dangerous’—After Vowing To Prohibit Fed’s ‘Digital Dollar’",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump expressed heavy skepticism about the security of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which he has vowed to block, in an interview released Friday, though he personally owns   in cryptocurrency himself, according to Forbes’ estimate, and hawks a line of NFT trading cards. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after  Trump said a so-called “digital dollar” would be “very dangerous,” claiming it could create a situation where money suddenly disappears from people’s bank accounts, he told Fox News in response to a question about his plans to block the Federal Reserve from formally issuing a digital currency. The statements echo a similar claim Trump made in New Hampshire last month, where he told a crowd he would “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.” While Trump has his own personal investments in digital currency, he was critical of the industry during his presidency, calling it “highly volatile,” though Republicans’ have proposed crypto-friendly regulations and Trump, if re-elected, is likely appoint regulators who would be more aligned with digital asset firms than the Biden administration, which is largely skeptical of the industry. The Federal Reserve has not expressed a definitive stance on digital currency, but has been exploring the possibility amid the explosion of private crypto and concerns that it could morph into an unregulated currency system outside of the federal government’s purview. Trump pivoted to artificial intelligence in responding to the question about digital currency in the interview, calling AI “maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything, because there is no real solution,” he said in a preview of the interview, set to be released in full on Sunday. “The AI as they call it . . . is so scary,” he said, referencing a fake speech he recently saw of himself promoting a product he “never endorsed.” Trump, in his New Hampshire speech, likened the creation of a central bank digital currency to a form of “government tyranny,” warning it would give the federal government the ability to “take your money.” The Biden Administration issued a 2022 executive order that ordered government agencies to develop policy recommendations and a potential framework for regulating digital assets. The process for developing a central bank digital currency could take years, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last year, emphasizing that it has not made a decision on its feasibility and is still assessing the public’s appetite for such a system, which would require approval from Congress and the executive branch, Powell said. In his New Hampshire speech, Trump credited his former opponent, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for warning him of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency. Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa primary and endorsed Trump, is among the names being floated as Trump’s potential running mate pick, as he is all-but-certain to clinch the GOP nomination, potentially as soon as March. Ramaswamy has also said a central bank digital currency would create “a mechanism for the government to be able to wipe out your bank account, wipe out your dollars if you say or do something the government disapproves of” calling it “a threat to liberty in this country.” Eleven countries have established a central bank currency, citing plummeting cash usage, increased accessibility, lower infrastructure costs and improved security. More than 100 countries are currently exploring the option."

    "title": "DOD Confirms: Taylor Swift Is Not A Pentagon Asset (And Travis Kelce Probably Isn’t, Either)",
    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. \"I mean I like her music, she's all right. But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

    "title": "Will Trump’s Criminal Charges Hurt Him In The Election? Polling Suggests Yes—But It’s Unclear If Cases Will Go To Trial In Time.",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "content": "Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade confirmed a “personal relationship” with District Attorney Fani Willis for the first time Friday, as Willis fights a push by former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants to have Willis thrown off the Georgia election interference case over the allegations. ulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appears before Judge Scott McAfee for a hearing in the  Wade acknowledged he and Willis “developed a personal relationship” in 2022, after he was appointed special prosecutor, in an affidavit filed Friday as part of Willis’ response to Trump and his co-defendants’ motion to have Willis disqualified from the case. Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

    "content": "The Japanese Embassy in D.C. reassured weary fans Friday that Taylor Swift’s concert in Tokyo next week shouldn’t stop her from attending the Super Bowl, as speculation rises about whether the billionaire pop star can safely jet from Japan to Las Vegas in time to support the Kansas City Chiefs—and her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce. Swift will be able to arrive on time to support the Kansas City Chiefs and Travis Kelce despite a  The Embassy of Japan—in a jokey statement filled with puns referencing Swift’s albums—  it can “confidently Speak Now” that Swift should be able to “comfortably arrive in Las Vegas before the Super Bowl begins” on Feb. 11 if she departs from Tokyo shortly after her appearance on the evening of Feb. 10. Those concerned about Swift’s arrival in Las Vegas “can be Fearless” knowing she can “wow Japanese audiences” before she returns to the U.S. to support the Chiefs while “wearing Red,” the embassy said. FlightAware spokesperson Kathleen Bangs told   Swift making it to the Super Bowl is “certainly doable,” adding she could probably make it to Las Vegas within 10 hours because Tokyo’s time zone is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas—giving her more than a full day to jet from Tokyo to Sin City. Swift regularly uses the Falcon 900LX and   private jets, which would be able to cover the 5,530 miles between Tokyo and Las Vegas   to refuel. Though Swift may be able to arrive in time for the Super Bowl, it’s possible there won’t be enough space for her private aircraft to park, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson   the Associated Press, as all 475 parking spots at the four airports surrounding Las Vegas are likely full for the game. Even if Swift can make it back stateside in time for the Super Bowl, it’s not clear whether she actually plans to go to the game. Heidi Hayes, a spokesperson for the Clark County Department of Aviation, told the Associated Press private plane parking around Las Vegas previously reached max capacity in November when the city hosted the inaugural Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Swift has made several appearances for Chiefs regular season games and recently attended the team’s conference championship victory over the Baltimore Ravens, often sitting in a luxury box with Kelce’s mother Donna. Speculation has intensified in recent days over whether she could make an appearance at the Super Bowl—which features the Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers—and support Kelce, as Swift is   to appear on stage in Tokyo the night before. The concert is scheduled to start at about 8 p.m. local time before ending around 11:15 p.m., or around 6:15 a.m. PT,   to NBC News. A Department of Defense spokesperson told   on Friday that Swift is not part of a “psychological operation” tied to the agency, rejecting   Swift and Kelce are part of a Democratic Party-led plan to boost President Joe Biden’s election campaign.

    "content": "As former President Donald Trump’s high-profile Georgia election interference case becomes increasingly overshadowed by his co-defendants’ conflict of interest allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, eyes have turned to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor in the Trump case whose relationship with Willis has put him at the center of those allegations. Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, has been accused of having an improper relationship  Willis hired Wade in 2022 to prosecute the criminal case against Trump and 18 co-defendants on charges of racketeering, violation of oath by a public officer and conspiracy to impersonate a public officer over Trump’s alleged scheme to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden—Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. Since his hiring, however, Wade has faced accusations that his experience did not qualify him for the lead prosecutor position in the Trump case, with Trump co-defendant Michael Roman arguing in a lawsuit against Willis that Wade’s “lack of experience” does not meet Fulton County standards “given the complexity of the charges.” Before joining the prosecution in Fulton County, Wade worked as a prosecutor and later as a judge in suburban Cobb County handling low-level criminal cases, the   reported, citing “scant evidence” of his record prosecuting major cases and no evidence of his work on a major political corruption case similar to the one Trump faces in Georgia. Wade’s record as a prosecutor primarily involves criminal defense and personal injury cases,     reported, while his law firm,  , lauds him as a “zealous advocate” with experience representing clients after major car accidents and contract disputes. Wade, who graduated from John Marshall Law School in Chicago (now part of the University of Illinois at Chicago), has also served as an assistant county solicitor—a position that handles misdemeanor cases—and   on three occasions for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court between 2012 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, Wade served as an associate municipal judge in Marietta, Georgia—just north of Atlanta—becoming the first Black man to serve as a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb. Since his hiring on the Trump case, Wade has faced criticism from multiple co-defendants, including four defendants who requested a “sanction” against Wade, including his potential “disqualification,” after Wade’s law office sent an unsolicited brochure depicting his smiling face and an advertisement for legal services to multiple defendants just weeks after their indictment in the case, the   reported. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case,   requests for punishment, finding the brochure was not sent intentionally, while admitting it was “embarrassing” for prosecutors.

Nearly $654,000. That’s how much Wade has been paid by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County  . Nathan Wade was thrown into the national spotlight in the midst of two cases involving his estranged marriage with Joycelyn Wade. The saga began last month when Roman filed a   seeking to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case on the grounds that her “improper, clandestine personal relationship” with Wade constituted a conflict of interest and violated public money laws, with Wade receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. Bank records also revealed Wade and Willis went on at least two vacations together: one to the Caribbean and one to Napa Valley, California. In Roman’s suit, the Trump co-defendant cited sources close to the matter, as well as Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife. The same day Roman filed his complaint, attorneys representing Joycelyn Wade   Willis in the divorce proceedings, with Willis set to testify at a hearing on Wednesday. That hearing, however, was abruptly canceled when Nathan and Joycelyn Wade agreed to a   to resolve their divorce. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee   Willis as part of a separate investigation into allegations her office planned to misuse a federal grant from the Department of Justice earmarked for a youth empowerment program. In a court filing on Friday, committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) argued Willis’ office planned to use nearly $500,000 in federal funding from the grant on “frivolous, unrelated expenses,” including on MacBooks and travel costs—Willis denied the allegations. Jordan also accused Willis of firing a whistleblower who reportedly attempted to prevent the funds from being misused—Willis claimed the staffer was “terminated for cause.” After two weeks of accusations, Wade broke his silence Friday morning,   to having a “personal relationship” with Willis in an affidavit filed in Fulton County Superior Court, though he denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with the district attorney. Wade also argued he had “no financial interest” in Trump’s election interference case, and stressed that no income he received as special prosecutor was “shared with or provided to” Willis. Wade’s affidavit was included in a 176-page court filing Willis submitted Friday morning, in which the district attorney rejected Trump’s request for her to be removed from the case, reiterating her argument that the case for her dismissal has no legal merit. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on whether to dismiss Willis from the case. Trump, who has repeatedly targeted Willis throughout his election interference case,   Willis once again in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, claiming she was “able to get her ‘lover’ much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual,” by bringing charges against Trump.

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s federal criminal trial for election interference will be delayed indefinitely, the judge overseeing the proceedings ordered on Friday, calling off an early March trial date to resolve Trump’s repeated attempts to drop the case on the grounds of presidential immunity. Former President Donald Trump's federal election interference case will be delayed. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan called off a scheduled March 4 trial date, saying the court will set a new timeframe “if and when the mandate is returned,” as Trump’s presidential immunity case remains pending in appeals. Trump has argued the case against him over his attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election should be dismissed,   he should not face criminal prosecution for actions during his time as president unless he is first impeached and convicted in Congress. Chutkan previously   Trump does not enjoy a constitutional right to presidential immunity, saying former presidents do not have the “divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs” fellow citizens—but Trump  , and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals still hasn’t ruled yet. Trump was   in August on four felony charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy against the rights of citizens, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstructing an official proceeding, following a federal investigation by Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges—one of a handful of legal battles he faces in the run-up to the 2024 presidential elections. In October, his legal team requested an appeals court   on the grounds of presidential immunity (while Trump was impeached for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, he was acquitted by the Senate). After Chutkan denied Trump’s request, Trump   that decision in December, with his legal team arguing that “no current or former President had ever been criminally prosecuted for official acts.” While Trump enjoys a comfortable lead in GOP primary polling,   have suggested his myriad legal battles could hurt his campaign when it attempts to sway swing voters in the general election. Only 29% of adults said in a Gallup poll released last week that they would vote for a candidate charged with a felony, while a recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll found 53% of voters in seven swing states would not vote for Trump in the general election if he is found guilty of a crime.

Trump’s lawyers previously  a request for documents they claimed showed the basis of the investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents was “politically motivated.” But in a 67-page   to the motion Friday, argued against the request, claiming Trump’s motion seeks records “based on speculative, unsupported, and false theories of political bias and animus.” Smith’s team also took the   of using the filing to lay out a lengthy rebuttal against claims of political bias, claiming Trump’s motion “paints an inaccurate and distorted picture of events” that, if unanswered, “leave a highly misleading impression on a number of matters.” Smith argued Trump and his co-defendants “cherry-pick exhibits” and “selectively quote” from documents to put a “nefarious gloss on innocuous events” leading up to Trump’s prosecution—instead, Smith argued, Trump’s prosecution was the product of “responsible actions by government officials diligently doing their jobs” in trying to collect documents from Trump that “as a matter of law, belong to the United States.” On Truth Social on Saturday, Trump didn’t reference the filing specifically, but reasserted claims of political bias, taking aim at “Deranged Jack Smith,” as well as the prosecutors leading other criminal cases against him, calling them “(President Joe) Biden prosecutors,” leading “Biden’s investigations for purposes of ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” Forbes has contacted Trump’s legal team for comment. Among other things, Trump’s legal team has argued that officials at the National Archives made a “sham” criminal referral to the Justice Department that cited communication with Biden administration officials that ultimately kicked off the prosecution.

The case centers on Trump’s alleged storing of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and alleged failure to cooperate with government officials who were trying to retain those documents. But Trump has long lashed out against the prosecution—and other criminal and civil cases out of Georgia and New York—as political witch hunts ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Trump faces dozens of charges across —in addition to the classified documents case, he’s been charged with racketeering in Georgia for his alleged efforts to pressure officials into overturning the 2020 election results. He’s also been charged in New York for allegedly covering up campaign finance violations by signing non-disclosure agreements over a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels and charged by Smith in another federal case for allegedly disrupting official proceedings by stoking the protests that led to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump’s prosecution in Georgia is facing headwinds amid allegations that the district attorney there, Fani Willis, had an inappropriate relationship with a prosecutor on the case. Willis this week   a personal relationship but argued it should not disqualify her from the case or affect the prosecution."

Presidential pre-game interviews before the Super Bowl started with former President George W. Bush, who   alongside CBS’ Jim Nantz in 2004. Former President Barack Obama later turned the interview into a regular tradition throughout his two terms after taking office in 2009. The pre-game interviews typically differ in format, including some live and prerecorded interviews that feature a mix of news anchors and morning show hosts. Fox has relied on its lineup of conservative cable show hosts, a decision that resulted in a heated   between Obama and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in 2014. Last year, Fox Corporation and White House officials   the other of pulling out of an interview with Biden before the Super Bowl. Fox later announced that Fox Soul—a streaming service tailored to Black audiences—would instead interview Biden, though that interview was later canceled by Fox,   to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. The Super Bowl is the premier event in American media, drawing well over 100 million viewers in recent years, with tens of millions tuning in for the pre-game show. This year’s game, between the reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, is especially hyped due to the expected attendance of pop superstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.

    "title": "Trump Has Racked Up Nearly $40 Million In Legal Fees Since His First Indictment",
    "content": "Trump’s criminal and civil cases cost him nearly $40 million in legal fees in the months since he was indicted for the first time in March 2023, according to filings from his leadership PAC Save America, as the ex-president used donor funds last year to battle cases that are only set to escalate before the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event on Jan. 27 in Las Vegas.  Trump’s leadership PAC Save America—which is paying the bulk of the ex-president’s legal fees—spent approximately $53 million between March 30, 2023, the date of Trump’s first  , and the end of 2023, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $38.9 million of that money   specifically on legal consulting and other legal-related services. That compares to $25.2 million that was   on legal consulting between Nov. 2020, when Trump first formed the PAC in the aftermath of the 2020 election, and March 29, 2023—with $8.4 million of that   during the first three months of 2023, right before the first charges against Trump were brought. Trump’s largest legal payments went to Christopher Kise, who represents Trump in his   and his criminal case for retaining White House documents, and Kise’s legal associates, with Save America paying Chris Kise & Associates $3.3 million and Continental PLLC, a law firm employing Kise and other lawyers representing Trump, $3.6 million between March 30 and December 31, 2023. Other attorneys representing Trump in his criminal cases were paid by Save America PAC, records show: Attorneys at Blanche Law, representing Trump in multiple criminal cases, earned $2.3 million; John Lauro, representing Trump in his federal election case, earned $2.6 million; Georgia election case attorney Steven Sadow took in $1.5 million and Susan Necheles, Trump’s lawyer in his Manhattan “hush money” case, earned $950,555, among other payments. Trump attorney  ’s firm Habba Madaio & Associates, which represents Trump in cases including his civil fraud trial and E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against him, was paid $3.2 million, while Dhillon Law Group, representing Trump in 14th Amendment cases seeking to disqualify him from the ballot, took in $579,408 in payments through Save America and additional payments through Trump’s campaign. Save America’s legal-related fees also include other payments, such as more than $900,000 to NYU accounting professor  , who appeared as an expert witness at Trump’s civil fraud trial, and   in May to a vendor holding ex-attorney Rudy Giuliani’s electronic records, in order to help the former mayor pay his debts. Save America has $5.1 million   as it goes into 2024, when Trump is   criminal trials in potentially all four of the cases against him. He faces two federal trials, one for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining classified White House documents after leaving office, as well as a trial in Manhattan for “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign and a state case in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts. (The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.) Trump has also already faced a civil trial against writer E. Jean Carroll so far in 2024, as well as the end of the fraud trial against him and his company, and will go to the Supreme Court next week to challenge a Colorado ruling kicking him off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment. It won’t be known how much Trump has spent in 2024 so far until the PAC’s next filing with the FEC later this year. Save America raised $52.3 million in 2023, according to its FEC  , with most money coming from either small-money donors or transfers made from Trump’s Make America Great Again PAC and the Trump campaign. Online donors to Trump’s campaign are told 10% of their donation will go toward Save America. Hotel magnate Robert Bigelow—who previously made a $20 million   to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ now-terminated campaign—told   Tuesday he donated $1 million to cover Trump’s legal fees “a few weeks ago.” The New York Times   it’s unclear where that money is actually going, however, given limits on PAC donations that only allow sums of up to $5,000. That means Bigelow couldn’t simply donate $1 million to Save America, the Times notes, and the donor and Trump campaign haven’t offered any clarity on where the funds are being directed. Campaign finance experts told Forbes that Trump using PAC money to pay his personal legal fees is a “highly questionable” legal gray area, though one that Trump can likely get away with. While campaign money isn’t allowed to be spent on personal expenses, the FEC has ruled that doesn’t apply to leadership PACs like Save America. But Dan Weiner, former FEC counsel and director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Elections and Government Program, told Forbes that paying Trump’s legal fees could still constitute an illegal contribution to Trump’s campaign, although Weiner noted the FEC “does not have a history of aggressively enforcing the law when there’s any sort of gray area,” and the Justice Department is unlikely to prosecute unless there’s evidence Trump knew the spending was illegal. “Because of lax enforcement, we have this kind of ‘Wild West’ campaign finance landscape, where there are a bunch of rules, but they are so unevenly enforced that people don’t have a good sense of what they can and can’t do, and that’s obviously a breeding ground for pushing the envelope,” Weiner said. Trump’s remaining rival in the GOP primary election, Nikki Haley, has pointed to the ex-president’s ballooning legal fees to attack him as a candidate. Trump “can’t beat Joe Biden if he’s spending all his time and money on court cases and chaos,” Haley   Tuesday, after the New York Times   on Save America’s legal spending prior to the FEC report being filed. On top of his payments to lawyers, Trump also faces the growing issue of having to pay out high-dollar amounts in his civil cases. A jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll   for defaming her on Friday, and New York state Judge Arthur Engoron is set to issue a verdict in the coming days in Trump’s fraud trial, which   in him having to pay up to $370 million plus interest. The payments could take a significant hit on  , as Forbes   the ex-president had $426 million in cash and liquid assets as of September. While Save America’s $5 million in cash means it couldn’t meaningfully help pay off those debts, it remains to be seen if Trump will try to use any part of his campaign funds on the damages awards, or try to raise funds through his PAC in order to pay them. “I don’t think it’s legal for the PAC to pay the damages award, but I worry that his lawyers will take the position that it can,” Weiner told Forbes. “There’s enough gray area that they might feel they have enough legal coverage to proceed.”  (Forbes)  (Forbes)  (Forbes)"

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks during a news conference at the Fulton County  Willis, who has not publicly responded to the allegations, plans to argue that she has not breached any laws that would require her to step aside in the case,  , citing sources familiar with her thinking. Willis has faced intense backlash since one of Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case, Mike Roman, alleged in a January court filing she hired a lead prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade, after the two had a “clandestine” relationship, his attorneys wrote, accusing Willis of violating ethical standards and creating an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman’s attorneys did not provide direct evidence on Willis’s alleged relationship with Wade, instead citing unnamed sources, though credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for flights for her to Miami and San Francisco—which Wade’s wife   can only be explained by a “romantic relationship.” Some legal experts have expressed doubts there is legal standing to force Willis or Wade off the case, but others have suggested one or both should voluntarily remove themselves as the allegations threaten to taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions. “I’d tell her to get out of the case. I really think in this type of case with these allegations, this case is bigger than any one prosecutor,” CNN legal analyst and former Georgia US Attorney Michael Moore   the network. “And I think probably to preserve the case to show what’s most important to her is the facts of the Trump case as opposed to her political career if you will at this moment.” If Willis were to recuse herself, it could potentially delay the case and push the trial beyond the November general election, as a   would need to reassign the case. Willis has proposed an Aug. 5 trial date in the case, which charges Trump and 18 co-defendants with racketeering and other felonies related to their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Willis has not publicly responded to the allegations, outside of a statement she made before a church congregation on Jan. 14 defending Wade’s qualifications and questioning whether her adversaries were “playing the race card.” Willis was subpoenaed to testify in the divorce case before it was settled on Tuesday. Contesting the subpoena request, she accused Wade’s wife, Jocelyn Wade, of “obstructing and interfering” with the prosecution against Trump in an effort to harm her reputation. Friday is Willis’ deadline to respond to the allegations. She could also be called to testify in a Feb. 15 hearing, where both sides will present evidence. The GOP-led Georgia state legislature also voted last week to form a special committee to investigate Willis."

    "title": "Taylor Swift At The Super Bowl: The Conspiracy Theory, Explained",
    "content": "Gamed: Right-wing influencers believe that Travis Kelce—and by extension Taylor Swift—reached the  At some point, Taylor Swift transcended into one of those celebrities who isn’t just famous, but scarily famous; she’s not a brand, she’s an industry. Swift’s extraordinary level of fame, success and influence has provoked the suspicions of reactionary influencers and conspiracy theorists. In conspiratorial online spaces, nothing ever just happens — big things are planned, and Swift’s boyfriend is going to the Super Bowl. Swift is currently dating football star Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, inspiring her fans to take a keen interest in the NFL. Swift attending her boyfriend's games   of conservative commentators who believe that Swift’s media buzz is distracting from the sport. More recently, it has lead some to believe that her presence is part of a convoluted political plot. Swift has been frequently and heavily criticized by conservative commentators ever since the singer spoke up in support of abortion-rights and accused former President Donald Trump of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism\"   (Twitter). Last year, Sean Davis, CEO and co-founder of conservative web magazine The Federalist wrote \"Taylor Swift is dumb and her music sucks\" on an X post that linked to   titled “Taylor Swift’s Popularity Is A Sign Of Societal Decline.” Political commentator Tomi Lahren gave Swift a backhanded compliment on her podcast, stating: \"Her lefty, liberal braindead political opinions aside, I am a fan of Taylor Swift and I have been since way before she went full liberal.\" Kelce previously sparked right-wing   after participating in an ad for Pfizer vaccines; conservative pundit Charlie Kirk   Kelce should be “shamed and humiliated,” while conservative influencers the Hodgetwins   that the NFL star had “sold his soul to Pfizer.” Conspiracy theorists were emboldened when Fox News   baselessly asserting that Taylor Swift is a Pentagon “psy-op” used for political messaging. Not long after, the Kansas City Chiefs secured their place in the Super Bowl following Sunday’s AFC victory, meaning Kelce’s game will likely be attended by Swift. Hence, right-wing influencers came to the conclusion that Swift’s presence at the Super Bowl is by design, with the intent to secure the election for Joe Biden through Swift’s high-profile endorsement at the winning game. The X account “EndWokeness” posted a picture of Swift on several magazine covers and wrote: “What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic and natural. It’s an op. We all feel it. We all know it.” Conservative influencer Benny Johnson used the same picture to emphasize the same point, in a reply to his own post asserting that the NFL was rigged. Johnson  : “Taylor Swift is an op. It’s all fake. You’re being played.” Former “anti-woke” presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy   a more complete version of the theory, prompting affirmations from other conservative commentators. Laura Loomer   that “the Democrats’ Taylor Swift election interference psyop is happening in the open… They are going to use Taylor Swift as the poster child for their pro-abortion GOTV Campaign.” Far-right conspiracy theorist Rogan O’Handley had the most dramatic take — O’Handley wrote a post to the San Francisco 49ers, begging them to beat the Kansas City Chiefs to prevent the death of “millions” and secure “the fate of the free world.” From an outsider’s perspective, Swift’s explosive rise to superstar might seem rather baffling — in some sense, Swift resembles MrBeast, a celebrity who has catapulted themselves to an unprecedented level of fame and influence through their carefully cultivated image, but doesn’t seem particularly charismatic to those outside the fandom. At Swift’s level of fame, the attention snowballs, with the media increasing coverage of Swift as she grows more popular, and fans obsessing over her every move. Not everyone will get Swift’s appeal, but the cumulative effect of her fame isn’t hard to understand — it’s just the market at work. Really, the conspiracy theory seems to have been forged in fear; it’s an acknowledgment that Taylor Swift’s voice holds power, possibly enough to sway the needle. Last year, an Instagram post from Swift encouraging her fans to vote sparked results — NPR   a whopping 1,226% increase in voter registrations the hour after she posted. The funny thing is, Swift is not a particularly outspoken celebrity when it comes to politics. \"Part of the fabric of being a country artist is don't force your politics on people,\" Swift explained in the 2020 documentary  . \"Let people live their lives. That is grilled into us.\" Years ago, Swift was very careful to keep her political opinions to herself (in fact, conservatives   she was secretly a Trump supporter). Like the majority of  , Swift leans liberal. In 2018, Swift was more politically outspoken, urging her fans to vote against Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who was running for Senate at the time. On Instagram, Swift cited Blackburn’s voting record as evidence that spoke for itself: \"[Blackburn] voted against equal pay for women,\" Swift wrote. “She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.\" Blackburn won that election, despite Swift speaking out against her. But Swift’s instinctual rejection of conservative culture war issues aligns with the views of her fans; Gen Z’s   and   is well-documented. Other than speaking out for abortion rights and calling on her fans to vote, Swift has not been politically active in the last couple of years. Swift did endorse President Joe Biden in 2020, and according to  , the Biden campaign is actively courting Swift’s endorsement again, and they’re open to suggestions — one idea was even to have President Biden make an appearance on Swift’s Eras Tour (hopefully, he won’t refer to Taylor as “Britney”  ). Rigging the Super Bowl, however, seems like a tremendous amount of effort to win that endorsement. The theory is especially absurd when one considers that the Taylor Swift conspiracy is mainly touted by influencers who believe the last election was rigged (if President Biden holds the power that conspiracy theorists believe he does, one wonders why they bother to vote at all). Swift might not endorse President Biden this time around — she might not even have time to make the Super Bowl. But for conservative influencers, Swift’s mere presence at the stadium seems threatening. Perhaps she reminds them that their culture war is a losing battle."

    "title": "House GOP Subpoenas Fulton County DA Fani Willis Amid Trump Criminal Case",
    "content": "The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani Willis on Friday, over allegations Willis’ office planned to misuse federal funds and fired a whistleblower—as the Fulton County prosecutor faces scrutiny after bringing racketeering charges against former President Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the   demanding documents from Willis’ office, citing a whistleblower allegation that Willis’ office “planned to use” a nearly $500,000 federal grant earmarked for a youth empowerment and gang prevention program to instead “cover frivolous, unrelated expenses.” The allegations are unrelated to Willis’ criminal case against Trump, which accuses the former president of illegally trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Jordan claimed in a letter to Willis that the district attorney failed to comply with multiple House committee requests for documents on her use of federal grant money, though Willis’ office has   those, arguing in a letter last fall that the requests are an unconstitutional “Attempt to Interfere” with state criminal cases. The subpoena comes as Willis faces allegations she used federal grant funding for MacBooks, other “swag” and “travel,” and that her office fired an employee who had attempted to prevent the office from allegedly misusing federal grant funding, the right-wing   reported. Willis criticized the allegations against her as “false,” claiming the employee was “terminated for cause” and that the grant funding has been “focused on helping at-risk youth and seeking justice for sexual assault victims.” Willis has been ensnared in a separate divorce case involving one of her lead Trump prosecutors for several weeks, as well as in a case brought by one of Trump’s 18 co-defendants accusing her of violating conflict of interest laws. In a court filing last month, Trump co-defendant Mike Roman alleged Willis violated ethical standards by engaging in a clandestine relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to the Trump case.   presented in the divorce case revealed Wade and Willis took trips together to the Caribbean and Napa Valley in 2022 and 2023, which Wade paid for. Willis has not denied the relationship with Wade, though she has rebuffed a separate subpoena in the divorce case,   in a court filing that Wade’s wife, Joycelyn Wade, had been “obstructing and interfering” with Trump’s RICO case in an attempt to damage her reputation. Willis reportedly plans to argue she has not broken any laws requiring her to step down from the case, sources told   on Thursday. Willis was   earlier this week to testify at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on whether she should be removed from the racketeering case for allegedly violating conflict of interest laws. Georgia Republicans, meanwhile, have launched a state   into Willis over the allegations, while multiple state GOP members have called for Willis to be  . Trump was indicted last August on   in Fulton County, including charges of racketeering, solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, over his alleged role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election—Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied any wrongdoing. Still, Willis has faced wide-ranging GOP backlash after she   against Trump, with Trump labeling the case a “witch hunt” and state Republican lawmakers calling to convene a legislative session last year to remove Willis from office—Republican Gov. Brian Kemp   that bid.

Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade settled a divorce case with his wife, meaning District  Cobb County Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson approved a temporary settlement on Tuesday, noting that Wade and his wife, Joycelyn Wade, will agree to the exact terms of the settlement outside of the court.

Then-President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House on January 6,  A panel of appeals court judges will hear Trump’s motion to dismiss federal charges against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election Tuesday, as Trump argues the indictment should be thrown out because he’s “immune” from criminal prosecution for acts he undertook in office. The appeals court was asked to hear the case after U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan   Trump’s argument—declaring the ex-president’s time in the White House doesn’t give him the “divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens”—and the Supreme Court   to hear the case immediately before the appeals court could rule.

The DOJ has long   that presidents cannot be criminally indicted while in office—arguing in a memo it “would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch”—and the Supreme Court ruled in   that presidents can’t be held liable in civil cases for actions they undertook as part of their official duties, though the high court separately found in   that presidents can be sued in civil court for actions taken before they were president. Whether ex-presidents can face criminal charges for actions they took while in the White House is still unsettled, however, with the Supreme Court yet to weigh in on that particular issue. Federal district and appeals court judges have   the civil cases against Trump for allegedly inciting Jan. 6 can   despite the   precedent, saying Trump’s efforts to overturn the election and allegedly encourage supporters to riot were not part of his official duties as president. Courts have also     Trump’s immunity claims in Carroll’s case against him, with an appeals court finding in December that Trump didn’t bring up the immunity argument soon enough for it to be used in the case. It’s unclear when the appeals court will rule after it hears arguments Tuesday in the federal election case, and once it does, it’s likely the case will get appealed again and ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. The appeals process is expected to delay Trump’s planned March trial date in the criminal case, though it’s too soon to say by how much. Trump has also   he intends to appeal the immunity rulings against him in the Carroll and Jan. 6 civil cases to the Supreme Court. Trump asked the state judge overseeing his criminal case in Georgia to throw out the charges against him due to presidential immunity on Monday, but it remains to be seen how quickly the court will rule. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all of the criminal charges against him. The Supreme Court has ruled against Trump having legal immunity once before,   in 2020 that the then-president had to comply with a grand jury subpoena for his tax returns. “No citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. Trump has argued he’s given immunity by the Constitution’s Impeachment Judgment Clause, which suggests judgements in impeachment cases “shall not extend further than to removal from Office,” which the DOJ noted means, in Trump’s view, that “the President may be charged by indictment only in cases where the President has been impeached and convicted by trial in the Senate.” In his original   to dismiss the indictment, Trump also pointed to the   ruling, claiming “the exact same, if not more elevated, concerns [in that case] apply to potential criminal prosecutions, mandating the same absolute immunity.” Subjecting presidents to criminal charges would violate the separation of powers between government branches, Trump argued, insisting that impeachment and conviction by the Senate is the “exclusive method of proceeding against a president for crimes in office.” The DOJ Trump is not entitled to immunity from criminal charges, claiming in its appeal to the Supreme Court that “the Constitution’s text, structure, and history do not support that contention.” The DOJ argues Trump’s claims about impeachment being the only way to hold presidents accountable isn’t supported by history and “collapses under the application of common sense.” Prosecutors also point to examples throughout American history to suggest presidents aren’t immune from criminal charges, such as President Gerald Ford having to pardon President Richard Nixon “for all offenses against the United States which he … has committed or may have committed or taken part in” while in office. “Whatever immunities a sitting President may enjoy, the United States has only one Chief Executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong “get-out-of-jail-free” pass,” prosecutors argued. “Former Presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal criminal liability.” Trump was indicted on   for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one of four pending criminal cases against the ex-president and one of two cases involving the 2020 election, along with the Georgia case. The charges could result in prison time if Trump’s convicted. Trump’s appeal of the presidential immunity question threw a wrench into the federal election case, which prosecutors have tried to shepherd quickly to trial before the 2024 election. Chutkan   all proceedings in the case after Trump   the judge’s order that shut down his motion to dismiss, throwing his planned March trial date into doubt. The DOJ   the Supreme Court to take up the case swiftly before the appeals court could rule, in order to keep the proceedings more on schedule, but the high court refused the government’s request without any explanation. Trump is expected to   the court proceedings on Tuesday, he confirmed on Truth Social Monday.  (Forbes)  (Forbes)  (Forbes)  (Forbes)"

    "title": "DOD Confirms: Taylor Swift Is Not A Pentagon Asset (And Travis Kelce Probably Isn’t, Either)",
    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. \"I mean I like her music, she's all right. But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

    "title": "Will Trump’s Criminal Charges Hurt Him In The Election? Polling Suggests Yes—But It’s Unclear If Cases Will Go To Trial In Time.",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "title": "Why Conspiracy Theorists Think Taylor Swift Is A Pentagon ‘Psy-Op’",
    "content": "Screenshot from the Jan. 9, 2024 episode of the Fox News show featuring Jesse Watters alleging  Have you heard the claim that musician Taylor Swift is a secret “psy-op” used by the Pentagon to influence public opinion? It was a claim largely relegated to conspiracy theorists on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, before Jesse Watters did a segment about the idea on Fox News on Tuesday. But the Fox News segment takes a viral video wildly out of context. Watters played a clip from a NATO conference, but didn’t give any necessary context to his viewers about what they were watching. And Watters seems to think Swift’s popularity in itself is a sign of some dark forces pulling strings behind the scenes. “Have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?” Watters asked viewers after rattling off Swift’s accomplishments on Tuesday night in a segment first flagged by  . “Well, around four years ago, the Pentagon psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset during a NATO meeting. What kind of asset? A psy-op for combatting online misinformation,” Watters told viewers. Watters then played a heavily edited clip of a presentation given by an academic, suggesting there was some nefarious reason Swift and her music are so popular. “Yeah, that’s real. The Pentagon psy-op unit pitched NATO on turning Taylor Swift into an asset,” Watters continued. But what’s actually going on here? Something much more nuanced and less sensationalistic than what Watters is telling his audience. The woman in the clip, Alicia Marie Bargar, was giving a presentation about research she’d conducted with her team at Johns Hopkins University about how information spreads online. Bargar was presenting at the 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict, organized by NATO in 2019, though she’s a civilian and has no known contracts or relationship with the U.S. military. Bargar is an academic who was simply presenting her research at a conference on how information travels through social media. The entire presentation from 2019 is  , and it’s clear from the introduction that Bargar’s presentation is about hypothetical scenarios for how information can be manipulated. Bargar uses Taylor Swift as an example clearly because she’s the biggest pop star in the world right now. “The first one, and the most common [example of influence], is working with famous people or influencers to share information of a particular message. I include Taylor Swift in here because she’s a fairly influential online person, I don’t know if you’ve heard of her,” Bargar said jokingly. Bargar goes on to explain that Swift was standing next to a sign promoting voting in the most general way possible. The image from the presentation is a screenshot from an Instagram post showing Swift waiting in line   to vote. “Celebrities, at least in the U.S., regularly will post pictures of themselves with an encouragement for people to go vote, and this has a measurable effect on voter turnout,” Bargar said in her 2019 presentation. Instagram post by Taylor Swift from 2016 telling people to go out and vote. That’s it. Bargar wasn’t saying that anyone should use Swift as a way to influence public opinion on any given topic, just that she’s an example of a famous person with influence who once gave a generic “go vote” message to her fans on Instagram. And by watching the full presentation you can see how Watters stripped all the nuance and context out of what his viewers were watching, instead presenting a very distorted and intellectually dishonest argument. The way Watters tells it, this was a NATO “meeting” where people were just floating ideas about how to turn Taylor Swift into a tool for propaganda against the American public. In reality, it was a conference where an academic presented research about the flow of information and gave Swift as an example of someone with influence because she’s literally the biggest musician on the planet right now. There’s absolutely no evidence that the U.S. government or anyone else is using Swift as a tool of spreading misinformation, as Watters continually suggested on Tuesday. Watters didn’t stop there, though. The Fox News host brought on  , a former FBI agent, to elaborate on all the spooky hypotheticals about how Swift would indoctrinate the country’s youth to vote for Joe Biden. Again, this is all speculation with virtually nothing grounded in reality. The video of Bargar’s full presentation is quite interesting, showing how researchers are able to identify various threats, like social media accounts associated with the terror group ISIS. Bargar also notes during her presentation that her influence operations are often inspired by how public health messages operate, a subject that was obviously less controversial in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic would become a political football. However, Watters didn’t draw attention to the nuances of that research. Rather, he built the segment around the idea that major music figures would be trying to brainwash kids. Swift has long been thought by relatively fringe elements to be a psy-op. After   magazine named her person of the year near the end of 2023, chatter about how she would be “weaponized” in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election got louder, with allegations that Swift fans are zombies who can’t think for themselves. “Taylor Swift has a cult-like following that would drink poisoned Kool Aid for her. The media knows this and is feeding it,” the X account known as End Wokeness tweeted roughly  . “Music. Entertainment. Sports. Now they crowned her Person of the Year. The next step? Politics. If you don’t think the regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024, you clearly have not been paying attention,” the account continued. End Wokeness may be seen as a fringe voice online, but none other than Elon Musk, the owner of X, has frequently engaged with the account’s content. And that’s how many of the stranger conspiracy theories online now find their way into the public discourse, eventually landing on mainstream channels like Fox News. Call me crazy, but if I was going to run a psychological influence operation with a major celebrity, I probably wouldn’t produce a video about that exact possibility. I’ve reached out to the Fox News media office for comment about Tuesday night’s segment and will update this post if I hear back."

    "content": "British Formula One star Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes at the end of the upcoming season and is set to join Ferrari in 2025, according to    , in what could be one of F1’s biggest moves in nearly a decade. Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

    "content": "Winner: Best Single Image in a Portfolio: A young Kalash school girl in Chitral, Pakistan Revealing the beauty and wonder of our planet, from gorgeous wildlife and mysterious landscapes to unexpected photos of leisure, tragedy and adventure taken by travelers around the world, the winning images of  have been unveiled. For the 21st year of “Our Planet In Focus,” the competition’s prizewinning images show us the highs and lows of , captured through the lenses of talented photographers of all ages, including “lyrically beautiful European agricultural landscapes, heartbreaking shots of elephants searching for food on rubbish dumps, inspirational athletes still competing in their 80s and 90s and photographs capturing the friendship between a rescued pangolin and her carer.” The winners were chosen from more than 20,000 images by amateur and professional photographers of all ages from 150-plus countries. The overall award (below) went to Slovenian photographer AndreJa Ravnak for her depiction of hops growing in Slovenia and her images of rolling fields in Italy and Czechia (Czech Republic) “that combine a fairytale beauty with the structure one might expect from her ‘regular job’ as an architect.” There is a subtle elegance about this year’s winners,” said TPOTY founder Chris Coe. “This comes through in both of AndreJa’s winning portfolios. One takes us into simple landscapes, with delicate colors and a textural beauty, the other into the hop fields, out of season and undressed, ready for the next planting. Neither are obvious subjects, neither photographed at an optimal time of year and yet they are both engaging and rather beautiful.” Travel Photographer of the Year was founded in 2003 and has become one of the world’s leading travel photography awards. “We are enthusiastically documenting this wonderful world, and perhaps this is a small contribution, a reminder to preserve its wonder for future generations,” the new Travel Photographer Of The Year said. The 2024 awards will launch at the end of April/beginning of May with  Overall Winner Early in the spring, the first rains allow wheat to grow in the rolling fields near Pienza, Tuscany in Italy. Due to the cold nights, the landscape is often shrouded in beautiful mists on clear mornings. This agricultural landscape is sparsely populated, with land being used to its fullest potential. Farms are located atop individual hills. Overall Winner Once all the strings are manually stretched, workers ensure that the small hop seedlings start climbing up at Slovenia’s Savinjska valley near Braslovce. When finished, they leave the Savinja Valley for a few months and return in late summer, when the hops are ripe for harvesting. Winner, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A dual shot of a Mobula ray fever cruising below a divers’ boat as part of their annual migration in La Ventana, Baja California, Mexico. Special Mention, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A yellow armadillo, in mid-air, comes galloping down a pathway at a secluded lodge in Brazil’s Pantanal wetlands. Runner Up and Special Mention, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio  Mateo smiles as Marimba nestles into her safe place, tucked under Mateo's chin at the Wild is Life Sanctuary in Harare, Zimbabwe. Marimba, a ground pangolin, was around a year old when her mother was poached for her scales. Marimba was too young to fend for herself and was taken to the sanctuary, where she met her full-time carer Mateo. Pangolins are notoriously difficult to look after in captivity, requiring particular and personal care. Mateo’s gentle nature seemed like a perfect fit and a remarkable relationship was born. Marimba and Mateo have spent 10 hours a day together for the past 13 years and are inseparable. Many attempts have been made to re-wild Marimba, but she always finds a way back to Mateo who refers to her as his last-born child. The Last Embrace, Highly Commended Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio   In Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park, a young female lioness feeds on a dead female elephant. This is a huge feast for the entire pride that will provide them with nutritional intake while the surrounding environment of the national park suffers from draught. For predators, each meal represents a huge and risk-fraught battle. Highly Commended, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A procession of Asian elephants in Sri Lanka’s eastern province weaves through a desolate landscape, designated as a dumping ground for humanity's excesses. The sight is both tragic and emblematic of the Anthropocene, an era where human influence shapes the geological narrative. Amid the discarded remnants of our civilization, these gentle giants unknowingly navigate a perilous course. Plastic waste, an unwelcome intruder, infiltrates their dung and stomachs, a poignant reflection of our collective failure in waste management. The echoes of burning refuse reverberate as millions of tons of waste enter the bellies of both wild creatures and their human counterparts, a heartbreaking testament to our shared vulnerability in this modern age. Winner, Best Single Image, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A discarded glass bottle in the ocean off Anilao, Philippines, has become a ‘crystal palace’ for a small, iridescent yellow Gobby. Winner, Young Travel Photographer Of The Year Fourteen-year-old Caden Shepard Choi won the title of Young Travel Photographer of the Year 2023 for her highly accomplished and well-observed black-and-white story of how the Navajo people of Chinle, Arizona, produce wool and use it in weaving. In this image, a Diné woman works on a rug started by her daughter. The master weaver sits perfectly still, but her hands are in constant motion. She weaves inside a Hogan, a hexagonal structure with a single door that always opens to the east, a sacred place for the Diné people. The woman positions herself in front of the open door to receive the blessings transmitted by the rays of the morning sun.

    "title": "Why ‘Batman’ Fans Hate ‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’",
    "content": "Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League sparked controversy with an edgy cutscene between Harley  There’s been a lot of drama and   surrounding the Early Access release of  , but a single cutscene from the game has sparked backlash from Batman fans who are upset with the depiction of the Dark Knight. As one would expect from a video game titled “Kill the Justice League,”   sees players face off against DCs’s most iconic heroes, who are being mind-controlled by the supervillain Braniac. The Flash, Green Lantern, Superman, and Batman all meet their end at the hands of the Suicide Squad, but the unceremonious death of Batman proved highly controversial. After defeating two members of the Justice League, the Suicide Squad successfully capture the mind-controlled Batman. Harley Quinn and Batman exchange words, with Harley giving Batman a piece of her mind; amusingly, she even accuses him of “causing long-term mental and emotional damage to everyone you knew.” It should be noted that in this story, Harley Quinn hasn’t dumped the abusive Joker as she often does in other versions— her Joker is dead, and she has been seeking revenge on Batman for some time. Batman asks Harley if she’s done with her \"bad stand up routine,\" and Harley replies that you always have to “end on your best joke\" before shooting Batman in the head, at point-blank range. That’s it — that’s the death of Batman. Specifically, the Batman featured in the  game series, which was largely beloved by gamers. The scene seems to be deliberately anti-climatic and subversive, with Harley gloating, “bet you didn't think it'd be me at the end, huh Bats?” The controversial cutscene has been  , and has sparked heated discourse among DC and Batman fans. Initially, Batman fans were  that that this grisly cutscene appeared to be the final performance of the legendary Kevin Conroy, who has been voicing Batman for decades across multiple mediums. Conroy is best-known for his performance in  , and is widely considered by fans to be the definitive voice of Batman. Following a battle with cancer, Conroy tragically passed away in 2022, at age 66. Hence, many fans found this portrayal of the character to be in poor taste. IGN has since  that   isn’t actually Conroy’s final Batman performance. Not to mention, Conroy himself chose to take the role — this wasn’t some ghoulish, AI-generated imitation of his voice. According to game director Axel Rydby, Conroy had no issues with the depiction of Batman. In an interview with  , Rydby said that Conroy “really enjoyed his performance in the game, and that was important to us that it felt like he liked what we were doing with the character as well.\" Otherwise, some fans have taken issue with the “disrespectful” tone toward the character of Batman. Fans of the  game franchise are disappointed that this underwhelming death at the hands of a relatively under-powered villain is the final fate of  Batman. However, this isn’t the first time Harley Quinn has bested Batman. In the “Mad Love” episode of animated series  , Harley successfully captures Batman and come surprisingly close to killing him. In an ironic twist, Batman is saved by the Joker, who is furious that his sidekick/girlfriend managed to capture his arch-nemesis. On social media, many fans were unhappy that the death of Batman was portrayed in an edgy cutscene that belittles the character — some were also  that the Flash was murdered and urinated on by a member of the Suicide Squad. Others mocked the backlash, pointing out that the game is literally titled “Kill the Justice League” and compared the tone of the game to an irreverent, edgy comedy like Deadpool. Generally, fans seem unhappy that   didn’t show Batman escaping through a clever back-up plan, or a deus ex machina, as the character traditionally would. One X (Twitter) user pointed out that the backlash was bad for storytelling,  : “gamers throwing a fit every time a popular character dies ensures that future games will be repetitive nostalgia fodder where nothing interesting can ever happen.” Of course, superheroes are killed (and revived) all the time in comic books, but fans don’t seem to appreciate an underwhelming defeat. In 2007, many Captain America fans expressed disappointment after Marvel unceremoniously  the character via a bullet from a sniper rifle. Much of the backlash to   was sparked by the quiet, unexpected death of Luke Skywalker, while the dramatic, heroic “deaths” of multiple Avengers in  were largely praised by fans. It’s unknown if the death of this Batman will be reversed somehow, via time travel, multiverse shenanigans, or some other convoluted plot twist."

    "title": "Saturday Conversation: Rob Bisel On Working With SZA And Grammy Love",
    "content": "Musician/producer/engineer Rob Bisel has eight Grammy nods this year for his work with SZA. SZA is the most nominated artist at this year’s Grammy Awards with nine total nods. As the co-writer, producer, mixer and engineer for the album  , Rob Bisel is right there with SZA. For his work with SZA, Bisel has eight nominations this year, including ones for the big three — Song, Record and Album of the Year. Bisel worked as an engineer for Rick Rubin at Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu. Rubin sent Bisel to Hawaii to work with SZA in January of 2020. During that time Bisel and SZA formed a bond that they continued while working together during the COVID lockdown. The result was SOS. Sage Bava and I met with Bisel and his dog Ponzu in his Los Angeles studio to discuss his creative process, his work with SZA, what he learned from Rubin and Kendrick Lamar and much more. Rob Bisel: It's definitely ramping up. There are a lot of events and stuff next week, various parties and mixer things. So, it's starting to get there. Yeah, the buzz is starting to pick up for sure. Bisel: Right, it's super exciting. And it's a good way to set up your next couple of projects. You never know who's going to be there. I have a friend, this producer, Earl on the Beat, and he produced the Doja Cat songs, “Paint the Town Red” and “Agoura Hills.” He said he met her at a Grammy party last year and just struck up a conversation. So, it's good to do the rounds, run into people. You never know what'll come out of it. So yeah. Bisel: Doja Cat would be cool. I don't know though. I'd love to meet a cool new artist that is doing something exciting. There's a good chance to find new talent too. So, I'm stoked to get out there and meet some people. Bisel: I'm trying to do more songwriter-oriented music this coming year. I guess that's not dissimilar from what I've done in the past, but it feels like there's a lot of good music being made by artists that are like writers' writers. Someone like Noah Kahan comes to mind, he's just an A-plus writer. And it's not uncommon anymore for writers of all different genres that can really carry their own weight when it comes to writing a song, which I don't think historically has always been the case. It wasn't uncommon for pop artists to be spoon-fed songs that they had no attachment to. Bisel: Million percent. I think we ran into a brick wall on one end of the spectrum of overly processed program music. Especially I think after COVID too, people want music that makes them feel like they're in a live performance, like in the room with someone else. Not just this alien sort of thing with no soul, no life to it. It's got to feel like it was made by a human. I think those human connections that can be communicated through music sometimes are more important than ever, just cause of where the world is at right now. Bisel: Elliott Smith, for sure. That immediately jumps off the page for me. Every decade, I feel like there would be someone different. But I don't know, when I think songwriters, he's someone that, for me, comes to the top of my mind. But, if I really thought about every decade I could spit out a couple different names for you. Bisel: I've been lucky to work with some amazing artists that can write. I really appreciate that. And I don't take that for granted. I don't think of myself as a crazy songwriter, but I think I'm good at giving perspective and feedback to good writers and helping challenge and poke holes in whatever they're doing, hopefully for the better. So yeah, that's how I see myself fitting into the whole little puzzle there. Bisel: There's a lot of intangible stuff for sure. I love working with people that are down to try everything. I like working with people that are down for \"dumb ideas\" and they'll even give those a shot. It's important for everyone in a creative environment for that to be the case, just cause you don't want to be over-thinking every idea because your dumb idea may end up being the breakthrough genius thing. And if you're in your own head thinking like, “Oh, so and so who's sitting five feet away from me is going to think this is stupid.” You're going to be second guessing and doubting yourself the whole time. This is not a fun headspace to be in when you're making music with people. So, first and foremost, that comes to mind for me. Yeah. Bisel: Something that comes to mind, in terms of production and stuff, is this SZA song, “Low.” The core of the beat is actually that accordion sitting right there, and it's this hard aggressive trap beat. You wouldn't really think of accordion, that wouldn't be your first choice of sounds for something like that. I don't think SZA ever balked at the idea of having an accordion song. The other people that I made that beat with, they didn't ever stop and think, “Why are we doing this?” They were just down to try stuff. That's one thing that comes to mind for sure. Bisel: One thing I work on is being really consistent about making things. I read a really cool interview with Jerry Seinfeld a year or two ago, where he talked about every day he sits down and just writes by himself for one hour. That's all he does. He isn't looking at his phone, jus him, a pad of paper and a cup of coffee. There are no distractions. I try to be habitual about sitting down and making stuff and knowing that even a little voice memo you make late at night as you're going to bed, that could be the core of a song someday. I think I'm pretty good at being able to polish up and get a song across the line. Bisel: Yeah, I learned a ton cause I spent several years working at a studio as a studio assistant and an engineer there. I was an assistant for probably six months on the most recent Kendrick [Lamar] album to come out. I learned so much watching his teamwork. They would make several different versions of every song and they'd record horns on something for a day and then they wouldn't even end up using it. Just seeing the dedication of that team and how willing they were to try a million things even if it almost definitely was never going to see the light of day. And not leaving any creative stone unturned. I'd say that was a really cool experience. I learned a lot from just watching them and I try to keep that in mind as I'm going through revisions of a song or trying alternate versions. Bisel: That's the magic of a song usually. I’m trying to always keep that in mind and protect that at all costs. It's easy to go down the rabbit hole and lose track of that initial spark for something. But I think it's always super important, especially as you're \"finishing\" up a song, to go back and listen to your first version of it or your first demo and just make sure that all these steps you did along the way actually were better. Cause it's easy to trick yourself into thinking, “Oh I put all this work and time into something, it must be better.” But oftentimes it's really not. It's really important to preserve that initial core idea. Bisel: it’s honestly her. It's funny cause I had a handful of people ask me what the gear was, what the plug-ins were, whatever. That stuff helps but it really is her. The best singers, that's always the case. In my days as a studio assistant, I was lucky enough to be in the room with some legendary singers. I was in a session with Neil Young thinking, “Oh, he just sounds like this. It's not like an effect or a mic. That's just Neil.” She has that indescribable quality right out of the gate. I try to do what I can so that when her voice is coming out of the speakers, it's more palatable to her and feels more in line with how she wants the world to hear her. I try not to get in the way and screw things up too much and get too heavy handed with it.   Bisel: Well said. So often people want to put their stamp on a thing. But I had a realization lately that the \"best producers\" almost always are the ones that are just working with the best artists. And if you want to get the best song, just put the spotlight on the artist, don't put the spotlight on yourself. You'll be a better producer for it, and the spotlight will in turn come back to you because you gave the people what they wanted. They don't want you, they want them. Hopefully that doesn't upset too many producers out there, but that's the truth. Bisel: Rick Rubin is an obvious answer there. I learned so much working at his spot in Malibu. I think he's the master of identifying what makes certain artists, unicorns and not getting in the way of whatever takes your breath away by hearing Johnny Cash singing in his later days. Not diluting that in any way, or what makes the Chili Peppers feel untamed."

    "title": "What’s Going On With ‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’ Reviews",
    "content": "Suicide Squad On Tuesday, Rocksteady   its first major game since 2015’s Arkham Knight, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. But if you’re wondering where press and creator reviews of the game are just a few days ahead of that, you’re not alone. This is not a situation where everyone has played and is just waiting for a day-before embargo, which is not   unusual. But instead, seemingly no one has actual copies of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League right now. I’ve been waiting for updates from the comms team for about two weeks now, and was supposed to hear something official yesterday, but didn’t. But asking around, the explanation is supposedly that since this is an always-online co-op game, the servers simply aren’t going to be turned on until the actual release on Tuesday the 30th. So no servers means that press can’t review the game ahead of that point. It’s…an explanation, I suppose. But again, for Rocksteady’s first enormous game in nine years, a hugely important title, it’s pretty strange, and it feels like something could have been concocted in, I don’t know, the last year, to still allow actual early playthroughs of the game for review. Even if this   a live game with a lot more content to come, starting a month after launch, there’s a sizable campaign to start with which obviously can be reviewed. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League It's also that this just wasn’t communicated at all. If the decision was made to not give out early copies because the servers wouldn’t be up, it seems strange that people were not told that ahead of time, and could plan accordingly. Now, it’s just too late anyway. I could get a code this morning and I simply don’t have the time to blaze through a massive game in two days for some sort of Monday embargo, and again, it doesn’t look like press can even play until launch anyway. I’m probably just going to end up buying the early edition myself at this rate. There is also the not-wholly-unthinkable possibility that codes are just not going out because WB is worried about reception to the game. This would be after a technically marred   where a lot of major outlets got their hands on the game for at least a couple hours, but the results were mixed-to-bad, overall. This led to an emergency release of the Alpha NDA where player feedback was more positive. But the idea may be if press didn’t like the preview, WB would rather do a day one launch with no reviews than potentially low ones. Can’t prove that, but given what happened with the preview, who knows. Even if it’s the server thing, this has not been handled well. It is extremely unusual to go into an “early access” launch that costs $100 with zero reviews of the game out. It is even weirder this is happening with Rocksteady, a beloved studio, and their first massive new game in nine years. So for me, my coverage will probably just be running commentary as I play the game starting Tuesday. And this will end what I would say is one of the worst pre-launch marketing campaigns I have ever seen for a major video game, regardless of its eventual quality.     ."

The film, which opens this weekend, faces scathing reviews. Currently,  holds a decidedly  , though there are no audience scores up yet so it’s impossible to compare the critics’ take against audiences at least on RT. The discussion among fans over on Reddit, however, is overwhelmingly negative as well. The general vibe boils down to this: I haven’t seen the movie yet—I think I’ll just wait for its Apple TV+ release—but  . At the time, I wrote: Since that trailer aired, we’ve all been bombarded with trailers for the film in one of the most egregious marketing zeitgeists I’ve ever seen. Now that it’s out, here’s what critics are saying. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times  , saying it’s “more exhausting than interesting.” The promise of sequels, he notes, “seems more daunting than exciting.” Roeper compares watching the spy flick to wasting one’s time watching a gender reveal party gone wrong: At first you can’t help but watch, but “eventually you kick yourself for wasting your time watching some idiots filling the sky with blue and/or pink smoke and fireworks as the whole thing falls apart in spectacularly awful fashion.” Adam Graham of Detroit News is “A spy tale with plenty of twists and turns but no sense of stakes or intrigue, \"Argylle\" is a convoluted mess of a story in search of a purpose beyond its own self-inflated sense of style.” Argylle The Bulwark’s Sonny Bunch  . “Almost nothing looks like it takes place in anything resembling a real location,” he writes. He, and other critics, have pointed out that the fakeness of it all would have worked if only the scenes from the book-within-the-movie were greenscreen/CGI, but since that’s the look for the entire movie it doesn’t work. Quoth Bunch: Kurt Loder,  , sums it up nicely: “The awfulness of \"Argylle\" is so nearly complete that one regrets even having to mention the movie's release.” Ouch. He praises—and sympathizes with—the actors. As with every other critic, Loder wonders why on earth they gave Cavill that haircut. Not everyone hated it, of course, though the critics that didn’t pan the movie gave it middling praise. Keith Garlington c . He writes: As always, make up your own minds but buyer beware.

    "content": "Find the links between the words to win today's game of Connections. Hey, folks! Welcome to the weekend. Let’s keep your  streak going. Today’s    hints and answers are coming right up. In  , you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s   answers.  Just after the hints for each of today’s  groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them. Today’s 16 words are: And the clues for today’s groups are: Need some extra help? Be warned: we’re starting to get into  Today’s groups are... Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s   answers. This is your final warning! Today’s  answers are... A breezy perfect game brings me to three straight overall wins. Having FIRM and COMPANY next to each other in the starting grid was a dead giveaway for the yellows. The combo of STABLE and STY was then the entry point into the greens. I suspected there was a group of typical dog names, but I couldn’t figure out the fourth one — I’d argue FLUFFY is a more common name for a rabbit. In any case, I guessed that for the fourth word and lucked out. That left me with the purples which was a good thing, since I wouldn’t have figured out that connection. A pretty tricky purple group today. That’s all there is to it for today’s  clues and answers. Be sure to check   for hints and the solution for Sunday’s game if you need them."

I get no points for guessing in four and -1 for losing to the Bot who got it in three. Alas! The word 'micro' comes from the Greek prefix \"mikro-\", which means \"small.\" It has been adopted into English and many other languages to denote something that is small in size or scale. This prefix is used in various scientific and general contexts to indicate a factor of one millionth (in measurements) or to signify something that is significantly smaller than the norm or standard size, such as \"microorganism\" (a very small organism), \"microscope\" (an instrument for viewing very small objects), and \"microchip\" (a small semiconductor used to perform logic and memory functions)."

    "content": "The Last of Us Part 2 Naughty Dog just released a   about the making of The Last of Us Part 2, a fascinating look at the controversial, widely awarded video game. And of course, somewhere in those two hours some news was made. Neil Druckmann says that he’s figured out a concept for The Last of Us Part 3 because there “probably is one more chapter to this story.” My theory used to be that The Last of Us Part 3 would be timed so it would release and given the HBO show more content to work with after Part 2 was split into seasons 2 and 3 of that show, which we already know is happening. That could have been maybe four years from now, but the timeline doesn’t add up for that based on Druckmann’s comments. Naughty Dog’s next game will not be The Last of Us Part 3, it’s something else, likely a supposed sci-fi IP they’re working on for Sony, which no, is not a live service. After The Last of Us Factions fell apart, Naughty Dog outright declared they’d remain a single player studio, so here we are. But Druckmann’s comments indicate that The Last of Us Part 3 is likely miles and miles away. I’m talking like, the next decade, as given both development time and a wholly new game coming out before it, that’s probably at least 2030, given that we are just in the “I came up with an idea for it” stage. The Last of Us Part 2 There are no hints given about the story content of the game. It’s safe to assume Ellie would return, though I doubt most people predicted a second Last of Us game would largely be without Joel, so who knows. A larger question would be if Abby would return after the events of the second game, or if her part in the story is over. The Last of Us just finished casting Abby for season 2 of the show, who will be played by Kaitlyn Dever, who also read for Ellie when the show was first being conceived. But because of the strikes, The Last of Us season 2 will not arrive until 2025. But yeah, on the generous side, I don’t think The Last of Us Part 3 will get here any sooner than five years from now. There were seven years between The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, with Uncharted 4 in the middle. Seven years after TLOU would be 2027, but again, just being in the “concept” stage does not really set the stage for release three years from now. So we’ll be waiting a long while for this one and you will probably be playing it on your PS6.     ."

    "title": "Two Weeks Later, ‘Palworld’ Is Still Steam’s No. 1 Game With 1+ Million Players",
    "content": "Palworld If Palworld was supposed to be a flash in the pan, a meteoric rise that would flame out quickly, well, it’s not happening   quickly. Two weeks after its January 18 release,  , currently with 1.3 million concurrent players, beating out CS2, Dota 2, PUBG Battlegrounds and Apex Legends, games which rarely, if ever, cede their top spots to anything else. And especially not for this long. It’s true that Palworld may have peaked a week or so ago, hitting Steam’s #2 all time high water mark with 2.1 million concurrent players, but it’s still putting up stunning numbers. And as of a few days ago, it was also the #1 most played game on Xbox Game Pass, a place where about a third of its playerbase resides. Pocketpair recently announced the game had 19 million players in just two weeks, 7 million of which are from Game Pass, and Microsoft has announced they will bring extra support to the game to help the small team manage things like updates and fixes and optimizations. They lucked out with this Game Pass pick, and they’re not going to let it go to waste. Palworld Why is Palworld still   widely played two weeks later, putting up Steam-best concurrents? Two main reasons: 1. As a multiplayer survival game with all sorts of customization options, it channels a bunch of previously popular games in the genre that you can play alongside friends, and when you add in Pokémon to the equation, it’s more appealing than many of them. 2. This game is a lot bigger than people realize. The map is huge, taking dozens of hours to fully explore. Base customization and building is close to infinite. And for the Pals themselves, you can have long term projects of not just catching all of them, and breeding and upgrading multiple Pals to get rare, powerful ones. Again, a process that takes a whole lot of investment, and a maxed out roster would be close to infinite playtime, with the way the game currently works. It's just such a cohesive whole, blending in mechanics from Fortnite, Pokémon and Tears of the Kingdom together in a way that shouldn’t work, but fit together seamlessly. Now that accusations of AI use and legal questions of the game “ripping off” Pokémon don’t seem to be going anywhere, it is free to exist and expand however it can. No, I don’t know how long the ride will last, given that interest may fade and I’m not sure if Pocketpair can deliver new content fast enough to hold the attention of lapsed players. But again, if you want to keep playing Palworld, the game is really good at giving you an extremely long list of things you can do. It has an endgame, as it were, and that has kept loads of players happy so far, it seems.     ."

    "title": "‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’ Review: Darkest Day, Darkest Knight",
    "content": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League How do you sell a game no one wanted you to make? That seems to be a question Rocksteady has not figured out how to answer in the nine years since the release of their last acclaimed Arkham installment, the series being a high water mark for superhero video games. Everyone was excited to see what they’d make next, but the announcement of   created little but confusion. Why pick them? Because they use guns. Why do they need guns? Because they need loot. Why do they need loot? Because the game is...a live service looter shooter. And that’s when fans’ brains began to break. The Arkham trilogy is a masterclass in single player, story-driven superheroing. But with the announcement of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Rocksteady felt like they were chasing after Destiny, and to a lesser, and less-successful extent, Anthem, Avengers, Outriders and the other PvE co-op looters that never caught fire or just plain died. After 30+ hours into Suicide Squad with three of four characters maxed, I can say the end result is throwing cake and soup in a blender. Each good on their own, pretty unpalatable when combined. There are glimpses of Rocksteady’s old Arkham brilliance in here, and there are even some shining examples of what you   do in a live service looter. But the entire thing does not work as a cohesive whole, and the promise of “wait it will get better in the next year or two” is a song that players no longer want to dance to. The campaign is not good. And gets increasingly worse as time goes on. While the cutscenes are incredible, the facial capture tech might be industry-best and there are some genuinely funny lines and physical comedy moments, it’s just…a very bad story. There are no real twists and turns here. No character growth or development other than the stupidly expected “these misfits eventually like each other somewhat.” And while some have mocked those that have balked that you kill the Justice League in “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” it does not in fact feel good either thematically or mechanically. Mechanically, because nearly all of its boss fights are poorly designed. Thematically, because well, it is kind of awful going around shooting JLA members in the head as they lay brainwashed and dying. While I don’t believe the entire Arkhamverse JLA will  dead due to some future comic book voodoo, this feels like an idea that sounded better on paper but is weird and uncomfortable in practice from a narrative perspective. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League But the   aspect, by far, is how the game handles the ending (no specific spoilers here). It has to contort the storyline to such an absurd degree to set up the narrative for its live service that it destroy any sense of drama or a climax it  have had otherwise. The final boss of the game A) is at the end of a literal tutorial for the live endgame and B) directly lifts a boss fight from earlier in the game. It’s all so shameless, especially seeing what Rocksteady has been able to do with stories that have beginnings, middles and ends. You cannot script two thirds of a story and tell people to tune in once every three months to see what happens. It has to be able to stand on its own. This instead stands like a superhero with their legs broken by a baseball bat. But the combat, oh, the combat. It’s  fun. That’s one of the things. The combat in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League can be extremely enjoyable. The action-packed gameplay is actually very engaging in practice, even if the insane UI looks terrible in YouTube videos. Once you sort it all out, once you master traversal, once you throw builds together, it starts humming. The combination of flight, grenades, melee and gunplay probably one-ups all the entire trio of Anthem, Avengers and Outriders fairly easily in terms of how it feels to kill things. A problem, however, is class diversity, which only gets a   better as time goes on. The game wanted to have loot, but everyone uses the same guns, albeit restricted to three different archetypes per class. 80% of the differences are based around traversal, which is…fine, and that does feel different in gameplay, but this is probably the most similar classes have felt in any shooter like this. They have different traversal, supers and either ranged or close melee. They all use the same guns, grenades, legendary affixes, gear sets and hell, even some of their skill tree perks are identical, even if sure, you can make a build like “Harley really likes grenades.” This is one aspect Avengers did better, creating   distinctive kits based on the hero’s powers, at least at launch. In Suicide Squad, the gearing and gameplay may be better, but diversity in playstyle is not. Diversity is also the key as to why even with shooting and flying being a lot of fun, the places where you   that shooting and flying get impossibly dull. It is shocking how much the same type of encounters are reused, almost all of which have you bouncing around 3-5 rooftops, clearing enemies in some fashion, and repeating for 2-3 rounds. These are the side missions, they are the non-boss fight campaign missions, they are the   missions, except set inside an alternate universe with…sand. While looters are often being accused of being repetitive, this is like if literally the only thing to do in Destiny 2 was public events. It’s repetitive on a level I have rarely seen in this admittedly repetitive genre, and I was genuinely stunned when I got to the endgame and it was more of the same. Suicide Squad The   exception is a pretty cool time trial horde mode, something that all looters should launch with and few ever do. You kill guys to rack up time as difficulty ramps up, and you can leave and escape with loot or go until you die. It’s good! But it’s one thing, and not enough. But  good is the next boss fight I uncovered which, you guessed it, is the same as the “tutorial” boss fight from 20 hours earlier, except with more health and modifier annoyances. The boss fights in Suicide Squad are  . Three in the campaign and then the one in the endgame are designed against fast-moving opponents you are supposed to counter-shoot, then plink them down before they move again a half second later. It takes everything good about the game’s combat and throws it out the window. You literally can’t use grenades, melee, ultimates, finishers, anything in these fights. And you probably shouldn’t use anything but an AR or Sniper Rifle to boot, so good luck, short range characters and builds. The one that isn’t like that is an all-time terrible Batman boss fight that really has to be seen to be believed. The only sort of okay fight in the entire game is against Green Lantern, and even that still has the “he’s really far away and you can’t use any of your skills” problem. The endgame, where the “real” game is always supposed to begin, is a frustrating mix of concepts. There are some genuinely cool things the game does with endgame gearing and character progression. It has systems looters should have from day one, but many have to patch in months or years later, if ever. Suicide Squad has loadouts, it has total weapon customization, enhancements and re-rolls. It has set items and unique items and set items that also work with specific unique items for compounding bonuses. It has infinitely escalating difficulty and a paragon point system for bonus stats across your squad. But the problem is, and remains, the activities. I’m only four days into the game now and I don’t know if I can run another Elseworld roof-hopper or Brainiac boss fight. The entire substance of the game boils down to the same 4-5 activities and a number of very bad boss fights, so all that fun combat, all that cool gear loses its luster relatively quickly. As a DC fan, I can appreciate the gorgeous renderings of these characters and some legitimately funny moments with members of the squad. As a DC fan, I hate the structure and concept of this story and the ending is legitimately insulting. As a looter shooter fan, I can appreciate all the things the game gets right from day one, and how snappy combat feels from a team that has never done anything like this. As a looter shooter fan, I am already bored of the endgame which is just a reshuffling of everything else that came before it in deeply uninteresting ways. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League I am concerned about Rocksteady after this, where they have committed seven years and now more to follow building and supporting this as a live service. But they created an answer to a problem that didn’t exist. People wanted more superhero games from Rocksteady in the style of Arkham.  is the polar opposite of Arkham in almost every way, and even if it’s still a talented studio making it, it’s not what almost anyone wanted. I believe people can have a fun enough time with combat through the short campaign and early endgame, but it will be a miracle if this does any better than its Marvel predecessor in the long run, another case of “why did they make this a live looter shooter” that never produced a coherent case for itself. I will play along. I will grind some levels, farm some gear. I will return in a month when parallel universe Joker shows up in season 1 to see how this all goes. But despite some clear bright spots, Suicide Squad does not justify its own existence and feels like a colossal waste of time, money and energy when any other normal, standalone superhero game from Rocksteady probably would have blown away Arkham sales records. Everyone wants live service games to print money, but when the genre makes your game unattractive at baseline, and no one sticks around, yeah, maybe you should have made that other game instead.     ."

    "title": "Live Service Delirium Is Something Publishers Need To Self-Reflect On, Quickly",
    "content": "Hogwarts Legacy There’s a new report of   being circulated that 500 studios, or 95% of those surveyed, are working on live service games in some form. That “form” may be loose, as it considered “live” games anything with frequent, ongoing updates, but even if those numbers are skewed, yes, it’s clearly a trend as stated by those running the likes of Sony, Warner Bros and countless other studios. The idea, in theory, is that one-off single player games might be able to sell well, but they have no ongoing revenue after the fact, and with big budgets, may barely break even or still even lose money. But it’s becoming clear that there may be no faster way to lose money than to go all-in on live service, as depending on the genre, even the “successful” ones are burning through cash and players at this point. I bring this up, of course, mainly because of the launch of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a game that appears to be selling relatively poorly, judging by the truly abysmal 12,000 launch day playercount on Steam, albeit we’ll need more data to be sure. There, it’s easy to see how the idea that the game was live service in the first place was a hard sell, much more so than another standard, standalone superhero game from the Arkham creators would have been. Meanwhile, also within WB, we just had the release of Hogwarts Legacy, which was the first non-Rockstar game to outsell Call of Duty in a given year in a decade, and now it has 25 million in sales. And yet, when pressed about its future video game plans, WB CEO David Zaslav can only talk about live games, recurrent revenue and ongoing engagement. But at a certain point, in an effort to print money for long periods of time, you are going to end up lighting it on fire. Suicide Squad Suicide Squad is the best example of this. A Rocksteady Superman game, were one to exist, probably could have easily sold 15 million copies. Here, you have to convince people to pay $70 for a Suicide Squad game, a concept you cooked up so it could function as a looter shooter in the first place, then create a story that has no real ending, and must feed into live content. Then, as you’re making the game, and for an indefinite period of time after, you have to make   content, new characters, missions, loot, etc. And in this case, you’re not even selling that content, you’re selling cosmetics in the shop and cosmetic battle passes each season. It's a recipe for making both A) a game nobody asked for in the first place and B) something that is massively expensive to both produce and attempt to sustain. And if it fails to launch well (which seems to be the case with Suicide Squad) you have already committed to at least an extra year of content for something that is almost certainly not salvageable as a live game. This live service delirium is making some studios act wildly out of character. Sony pushed its studios so hard toward live service it blew up spectacularly, with Naughty Dog’s TLOU Factions being cancelled, years of work and millions of dollars wasted, and caused them to literally put out a statement saying they would remain a single player studio, as if live service was some sort of disease they’d just expelled from their body. It’s wild to me that a place like WB looks at a game like Hogwarts Legacy, one of the most successful non-sequel game launches of all time as a single-player, microtransaction-free experience and goes “but yes we should make more games in the Suicide Squad model.” Then you can shift your gaze a few degrees to look at the most explosively popular game of this year, Palworld, a game that yes, is “live” with online multiplayer and future updates, but there are no seasons, no microtransactions, you can easily play solo and have a great time. And it has gotten 19 million players in two weeks with a budget 2% the size of AAA blockbusters. It feels to me like the answer to expensive single player games is not to chase after live service, but to figure out how to…make them less expensive, but still fun enough to sell. Throwing your lot in with live service is like playing Squid Game with the rest of the industry. You may have 500 attempts but because of the “you must commit to and keep paying for this for months or years” concept, only a scarce few will succeed and almost all will crash and burn. It is much, much easier for players to commit to a single player game you play over a few weeks or a month and then move on. And even those, when longer and requiring more playtime, are   potentially massive hits, like Baldur’s Gate 3, easy GOTY winner and a largely single player game still putting up hundreds of thousands of players daily on Steam when it was released in August. Making any video game is hard. Making a live service game is becoming more like a death sentence in terms of investment. This  a dollars and cents thing. Companies have seen a few select live games do very well and think all their IP can now be turned into that. But they can’t. The industry won’t sustain it, the players won’t tolerate it. I would say this bubble is bursting, but that already happened. The corpses of Anthem, Avengers, Godfall, Outriders, Redfall weren’t enough to say that Suicide Squad would fail? We’ve been doing this for years and almost no one is making lightning strike here. Make good games. You cannot force players to like something or force an unrelated genre to fit into being a live service. It won’t work. It hasn’t worked. How many smash hit standalone games do we need to see and how many dead live services must we amass before publishers get the message?     ."

    "content": "Find the links between the words to win today's game of Connections. Hey there, everyone! Happy Friday. I hope you have a super relaxing end to the week as we ease into the weekend. Today’s    hints and answers are coming right up. In  , you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s   answers.  Just after the hints for each of today’s  groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them. Today’s 16 words are: And the clues for today’s groups are: Need some extra help? Be warned: we’re starting to get into  Today’s groups are... Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s   answers. This is your final warning! Today’s  answers are... No perfect game today, but back-to-back wins are always welcome. I found today’s game a little easier than it looked at first glance, and I think figuring out the groups in order of difficulty helped quite a bit. BREAK and RECESS gave me an entry point into the yellows. I was slightly stumped as to which word should go with BUCKLE, LOOP and STRAP. I made an incorrect guess (HOLEY) before remembering the mantra of “keep it simple” and correctly including HOLE. From there, I figured I should try to group together the homophones, and that worked. I didn’t deduce the purple connection before completing that group (I am unfamiliar with “dogwood”), but a win is a win. That’s all there is to it for today’s  clues and answers. Be sure to check   for hints and the solution for Saturday’s game if you need them. P.S. The mention of driftwood got this song from a band I loved as a kid stuck in my head. It’s terrific."

    "title": "‘True Detective: Night Country’ Full Season Review: One Of The Worst Mysteries Ever Made (No Spoilers)",
    "content": "True Detective: Night Country is one of the worst mystery shows I’ve ever seen. I’m struggling to think of another detective series that I despised as much as I despised this one in the end. Season 2 was a disappointing follow-up to the first season of  but this doesn’t even feel like the same show, despite its many attempts to convince us otherwise. When  first aired, I wanted to watch one episode at a time alongside viewers despite having access to all six episodes ahead of time. I’ve done this with a number of shows because it keeps me on the same page as audiences. I can guess along with everyone else, make predictions along with everyone else and so forth. It’s fun a lot of the time, especially with mysteries, and it allows me to write about each episode from that perspective, still uncertain of what’s coming. I gave up after episode 3 of  and watched the next three episodes for for one simple reason: I wasn’t enjoying the show enough to care about what happened that much, and I wanted to know if it got better. Was there a satisfying payoff at the end that made the slog I’d endured so far worthwhile? I can safely answer that question with a resounding “No!” If anything,  gets worse in its second half. The show has an identity crisis, straddling the line between its origins as its own mystery and  . The mystery itself hardly feels like a mystery at all, with no sense of organic urgency or even a coherent investigation. Whatever plot is buried in the show’s admittedly fantastic setting is constantly bogged down in dreary, tedious exposition and repetitive dialogue. Characters constantly make bizarre decisions, and the sloppy script is in a constant hurry to spin its wheels. Every time something exciting or interesting happens, the show slams on its brakes, devolving into yet another tedious conversation or leaping to a new scene in the most jarring way possible. Occasionally, in various desperate acts of fan-service, a line from Season 1 is jammed in where it doesn’t belong. One Season 1 callback in particular during the season finale made me laugh out loud in dismay. I may or may not have shouted at my TV. Night Country None of the characters are particularly likable. That’s a big problem, though it could have been a tolerable one if the story they inhabited was compelling enough to make such crappy people watchable. Shows like  manage this delicate balancing act with style. Not so in  Jodie Foster’s Liz Danvers has barely a single redeeming quality and her partner, Detective Navarro (Kali Reis) is just as hard to stomach. You can get away with having a detective be this awful of a human being only if they make up for it with a Hercule Poirot-like intellect. Neither Danvers or Navarro possess much in the way of little grey cells, however. In the end, I felt nothing but disdain and disgust for both characters, whose actions in the season finale are beyond the pale. The creators of the show don’t seem to think so. They want us to connect with these detectives and the choices they make. Unfortunately, it’s never earned. Neither is the show’s utterly predictable, wholly unsatisfying ending—though if you like a good dose of cloying preachiness, this might be just the show for you. The ingredients of  make for a sad list: Predictable, boring, unpleasant, preachy, and derivative. Toss in a dash of bad CGI and some atrociously mediocre cinematography—not to mention all the lame needle drops—and you’re left with something that barely resembles   The final episode feels less like the franchise it ostensibly is a part of and more like a cheap knockoff of the film it cribs from so brazenly:  You’d be better off watching that gripping drama instead of this badly written snoozefest. (I’d urge rather strongly that you watch it first). I finished watching  on Amazon Prime Video earlier this week. The parallels between the two shows are astonishing. Both are loosely rooted in the Nordic noir tradition. Both take place in exotic small towns far from the big city: Ennis, Alaska and Deadloch, Tasmania. Both have a pair of female detectives investigating the murders of men, and both have overbearing male police bosses who threaten to interfere. Each mystery involves missing tongues, believe it or not. But  is a story with characters you care about, a crude but charming sense of humor, and a coherent mystery with actual suspects that keeps you guessing right up until the end.  can barely keep track of its messy, sprawling cast let alone whatever case it is the detectives are trying to solve. I predicted the ending (or at least  of the ending) in the season premiere. The only surprising thing about this show is how obvious it is. But please, by all means keep watching! I’ll be reviewing each episode as we go and I’d love to chat with you about it week to week. I suspect even the show’s staunchest defenders may be disappointed in the end; no matter what your theory may be—and there are many—I can’t see how this show’s conclusion pays off in any kind of satisfying way. Then again, maybe I’m just asking the wrong bleeping questions. Watch  : What are your thoughts on this show so far? Let me know on  and . Links to my episodic reviews:"

That should be ample time for Fury’s gash–which required 11 stitches–to heel. The interview was especially informative, even beyond the Fury-Usyk drama. Alalshikh discussed a few different scenarios for Francis Ngannou, Anthony Joshua, who are set to meet later this year in Riyadh, as well as confirming Dmitry Bivol-Artur Beterbiev as a main event of an upcoming Saudi event in June. Alalshikh also shot down a rumored request from Gervonta Davis, who reportedly asked for “2 Ferraris” to fight on an upcoming Riyadh card. During the interview, Alalshikh said, “we will give him [Davis] 2 gloves if he wants to play in Riyadh.” With each passing week, it’s becoming more apparent Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia now hold sway over a large portion of the decision making for major fights in boxing, and there are significant roots being laid in mixed martial arts. In any case, the biggest heavyweight fight of the year has an official new date."

For now, we enjoy the sun on our faces and the crisp, clear mountain air. Oh, and Wordle of course. We have one of those to solve today, I believe. Let’s dive right in!

The word 'verge' has an interesting etymology that traces back to both Latin and Old French origins. The term comes from the Latin word  , which means 'rod', 'stick', or 'wand'. This Latin root reflects the original sense of the word as something related to a physical boundary or a marker. From Latin, the word evolved into the Old French word  , meaning 'rod' or 'staff', but also used to denote the 'penis' in a more vulgar sense. The Old French term retained the meaning of a rod or staff used as a symbol of authority or power, such as the ceremonial staff carried by certain officials. By the time it entered Middle English, 'verge' had acquired a variety of meanings, including a rod or staff, the edge or margin of something, and even a boundary or limit. Today, 'verge' is commonly used in English to refer to the edge or brink of something, such as being on the verge of an important discovery or event, reflecting its historical roots in notions of boundaries and limits. This layered etymology showcases how 'verge' has evolved over time, carrying with it notions of authority, boundaries, and transitions from its Latin origins through to modern English usage."

    "content": "Last Wish Destiny 2 has now begun a six week stretch where if you complete an exhaustive list of  , mostly Dreaming City-based activities, you can get one token, per week, per account, to unlock something special. This event is mostly for free-to-play players, or those who have missed the last year of content. You can pick from Last Wish raid weapons to craft (well, one of them), Lightfall exotics or cosmetics/materials. So, here’s what I think you should buy, and this has to be written from a F2P perspective as I just don’t know how beneficial it’s going to be to most players: – This is one of the most meta rocket launchers in the game right now, if not   most meta, thanks to new updated rolls. This is sort of up to the user, but best for overall damage is probably  . You can also use  for damage or  for even more rockets, four at a time.  – They call it “Fakebringer” but it’s arc and as such, has a pretty fun roll in the form of   now. If I had my pick, that’s what I’d go for.  – Another fun updated weapon because it’s a rare one that can roll with two Void 3.0 perks at once,  which work great in synergy with one another. Briarbinds  These are not the best exotics offered, but I would say they are the best exotics that don’t use Strand or Stasis, which are   free, you need to own either Lightfall or Beyond Light. These three, Void buddy boosts for Warlock, Arc moth buddies for Hunter and giant flame tornado buddy for Titan, are your best bet. – Materials are lame, don’t bother spending tokens on that as there are so many other better ways to get them. Meanwhile, the Festival of the Lost black leather ornament is one of the best shaders in the game, and was only available for a few weeks during the event this year. I didn’t think there’d be another way to get it until next year, but here we are. If you don’t care about the raid weapons or exotics, grab up a bunch of these. Destiny 2 Fundamentally I think this event is bad because it’s focused on free-to-play players but giving them often   grinds to get even a fraction of what paying players got a lot easier, but I guess it’s better than nothing. That’s my advice for token spending, feel free to disagree.     ."
