    "title": "Underpriced Stocks In The Small-Value Corner",
    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "content": "Apple beat Wall Street’s expectations in its quarterly earnings report Thursday, massaging concerns about weak iPhone sales and a decline in the technology titan’s key China business, as rival Microsoft wins the hearts of investors.  Apple CEO Tim Cook appears next to his company's Vision Pro virtual reality headset, which will  Apple tallied $119.6 billion of revenue and $2.18 earnings per share (or $33.9 billion total net income) in the final three-month period of 2023, topping average analyst estimates of $118 billion in sales and $2.10 of profit per share ($32.7 billion total profit), respectively, according to FactSet. That marks 2% revenue growth from 2022’s December quarter and 16% profit expansion, figures far more paltry than those just reported by rivals   (18% increase in sales, 33% jump in net income) and   (13% rise in sales, 52% expansion of profits). Apple’s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales—its $69.7 billion of iPhone revenue last quarter marked just a 6% annual increase but topped forecasts of $67.6 billion—and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region which accounted for about a fifth of all Apple revenue last fiscal year. Shares of Apple dipped slightly in low-volume afternoon trading, declining 4% over the last week’s standard trading hours. Apple’s lukewarm earnings report comes two days after Microsoft   its fifth-consecutive quarter of record revenue and two weeks after Apple ceded the title of the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft, a crown held by Apple since 2021. Apple’s roughly $130 billion in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat Microsoft’s $113.6 billion, but analysts project Microsoft to become more profitable than Apple by next fiscal year, a fairly remarkable feat considering Apple raked in 33% more EBITDA during the 2022 fiscal year. Wall Street expects Microsoft’s valuation ($3 trillion as of Thursday) to accordingly surge further past Apple’s ($2.9 trillion). Analysts’ average price target for Apple stock of $199 implies a projected market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, according to FactSet, while their average price target for Microsoft implies a projected market cap of $3.4 trillion."

No programs were established by the resolution and no money was allocated. The move in California comes less than a year after Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy   about the \"loneliness, isolation and lack of connection\" in the United States even before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which   compounded feelings of isolation for many. Other states and countries are experiencing similar problems—the state of New York appointed an \"honorary ambassador to loneliness\" in November to address the growing problem of social isolation, the World Health Organization launched a Commission on Social Connection the same month and countries like   and the   have taken steps to address the issue. “People don’t live close to their loved ones anymore,\" Jennifer Steele, the CEO of the Meals on Wheels program that serves part of San Mateo County,  . \"Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones in some cases.

Meta-Gallup's Global   report found people in Africa and Southwest Asia to be the most lonely. At least 40% of people in countries like Afghanistan, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Uganda reported feeling very or fairly lonely. The least lonely countries were found to be Russia, Germany, Ukraine, Sweden, Norway and Finland, among others, where less than 10% of respondents reported feeling very or fairly lonely. In the United States, 15% of people reported feeling very or fairly lonely, 36% said they were a little lonely and 59% said they don't feel lonely at all. Concerns about loneliness are not new in the medical community, and research shows it can have detrimental impacts to both mental and physical health.  published by the National Library of Medicine found that those suffering from loneliness are more likely to experience depression, alcohol abuse, personality disorders and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and cardiovascular diseases. People who find themselves suddenly alone due to the death of a loved one or a dramatic life change like retirement can be at a greater risk for a variety of mental and physical conditions, the   says, while those who purposefully engage in activities with others tend to live longer, happier lives.

PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018.

    "title": "DOD Confirms: Taylor Swift Is Not A Pentagon Asset (And Travis Kelce Probably Isn’t, Either)",
    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. \"I mean I like her music, she's all right. But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

Jennifer   Thursday she “didn’t feel comfortable” being in charge of the gun, which she and James bought as a Christmas gift, later adding James was responsible for keeping the gun locked away. Though James was “entrusted” to store the gun, Jennifer claimed it was “pretty clear you didn’t trust James with much” because he had issues holding a job or handling his money. Their son also never asked for help with mental health issues, Jennifer said, adding he would sometimes have anxiety after taking tests at school and they believed he was “messing around” when he told his parents he was seeing demons in their home. Both Jennifer and James have pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Closing arguments in Jennifer’s case will be held later on Friday. James is expected to stand trial next month. Jennifer, 45, and James, 47, were arrested months after their son Ethan fatally shot four students and wounded seven others at Oxford High School in 2021. Prosecutors   both parents failed to prevent access to the 9mm Sig Sauer handgun used in the attack, suggesting the gun was left unsecured in a drawer in the parents’ bedroom. On the morning of the shooting, the school called both parents after a teacher found a note on Ethan’s desk that said, “the thoughts won’t stop, help me,” with drawings of a handgun nearby.   from Ethan’s journals also indicated his “parents won’t listen to me about help or a therapist” and expressed his desire to “shoot up” his school.

An asteroid floats in space. An 890-foot asteroid will pass by Earth on Friday, coming within 1.7 million miles of the planet—around seven times further than the Moon—and traveling at a speed of about 11 miles per second,   to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The asteroid, called Asteroid 2008 OS7, orbits the Sun every 962 days, so its next return will be in 2026, though its next close approach won’t be until  , when it will come within 10 million miles of Earth. NASA labels objects that come within 4.6 million miles of Earth and are larger than 150 meters as a “potentially hazardous object,” so NASA is monitoring its potential danger.

While the “Enhanced Movement” stresses enhancements as a “personal” choice for competitors, the contest’s website says it “embraces enhanced athletes” and wants to push the “perceived limit” of what is possible, with the ultimate goal of setting new world records. Team sports have been culled from the contest to better focus on individual prowess, and events will be held across five core sporting categories: athletics, aquatics, combat, gymnastics and strength. The Enhanced Games says it is going to be the “most inclusive sports league in history.” All adults will be welcome to apply to compete in the games, organizers said, regardless of whether they are “natural, adaptive, or enhanced, an amateur or a former Olympian.” Registration will open in late 2024. Precise dates for the contest are not yet known. “Contemporary drug testing practised in sports today is not necessarily about athlete safety; it often skews the public perception of fairness and health in competitive sports,” said Michael Sagner, a member of the games’ scientific and medical advisory board and a clinician and researcher in aging and sports medicine at King’s College London. Sagner said Enhanced will adopt a “sophisticated safety protocol” that will put athletes’ health first. The Enhanced Games’ organizers say they hope to avoid the excessive waste and costs associated with the modern Olympic Games. The Enhanced Games have been designed so they can be hosted at a Division One university campus, its website said, avoiding the need to build new stadiums and push cities into debt. It will also mean athletes can be paid fairly, boasts Aron D’Souza, president of the Enhanced Games. While the Olympic Games can generate billions in revenue, successful athletes see only a   of the bounty. “By focusing on world records in popular sports such as track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weight lifting and combat sports, we can eliminate wasteful infrastructure spending and reinvest to fairly pay all athletes.” It’s not clear how much athletes competing in the Enhanced Games stand to win. The games’ organizers   an exact prize pool and compensation structure will be announced in the middle of 2024. All athletes will be paid a base salary and will compete for additional prize winnings, organizers said. By nature, competitive athletes strive to be the very best at what they do and train hard to achieve this. Inevitably, athletes look beyond themselves for ways of getting an edge, which can range from an improved diet, training at high altitudes and exploiting advances in sports medicine and psychology to high-tech gear like bikes, shoes and swimming costumes, blood doping and drugs. A number of these methods, notably using drugs, have potentially negative health consequences for athletes and are viewed as giving an unfair advantage over other competitors. While there is no clear consensus on where the dividing line is between permissible and impermissible enhancement—the boundary often changes with new scientific advances as well—high level contests frequently test athletes to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Athletes in many professional leagues can be sanctioned or barred from competition for doping, and some fans reject any   who used performance-enhancing drugs. Critics   efforts like the Enhanced Games put athletes’ health at risk and undermine the integrity and fairness of sporting competition. Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN the idea of such a contest is “farcical,” adding that it’s “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” It’s also likely illegal in many states on account of the legal status of some performance enhancers like anabolic steroids, which can help boost muscle mass, Tygart said. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was   from competing internationally for four years on Monday for an anti-doping violation from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. She had won gold in the team figure skating event, though the medal has now   to Team USA. We estimate   has a net worth of $6.2 billion. The sum positions him as the 443rd   on Forbes’ list of real-time billionaires. Thiel cofounded PayPal and big data firm Palantir and was the first big investor in Facebook.  (The Verge)"

    "content": "Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman donated $2 million to help fund the campaign urging Democratic primary voters to write President Joe Biden’s name on New Hampshire primary ballots, newly filed Federal Election Commission records show, as Hoffman has poured his resources into a string of anti-Trump efforts in recent years. Reid Hoffman speaks onstage during The AI Optimist Club at WIRED Celebrates 30th Anniversary With  Hoffman donated $2 million to the Granite for America super PAC that led the pro-Biden write-in campaign in New Hampshire, where Biden won the primary last week despite his absence from the ballot following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties over the new primary schedule. Hoffman donated almost 99% of the $2,025,000 the group raised since its inception in November, according to end-of-year   released Wednesday. New Hampshire Democratic Party Vice Chair Martha Fuller Clark, a former state lawmaker, donated the remaining $25,000. The group, founded by New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan, spent $239,826 through the end of December while a similarly named group supporting the effort, Granite State Write-In, spent $31,623 of the $56,559 it raised last year, records show. Hoffman, a longtime Biden supporter, is a prolific donor to efforts designed to boost Democrats and challenge former President Donald Trump—he helped fund writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault suit against the former president, former Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) failed 2022 reelection campaign and has given millions to the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project. Hoffman also donated $250,000 to a super PAC backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s Republican presidential campaign, his political advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn told Forbes previously, and a non-profit Hoffman supports helped fund a super PAC backing former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s now-defunct GOP presidential campaign, according to the  64%. That’s the share of votes Biden won in New Hampshire, beating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who earned 20% of votes, and author Marianne Williamson (4%). Hoffman has reportedly decided to stop giving to Haley’s campaign after her losses to Trump in New Hampshire and Iowa,  , citing a source familiar with his thinking. Hoffman said in December he donated to Haley because his “first priority is to defeat Trump,” noting she “would not be as good for America as Joe Biden, but America would survive her administration.” Hoffman is among a growing number of megadonors re-evaluating their priorities as Trump appears poised to clinch the nomination. Billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of the Citadel hedge fund and a Republican mega donor, also gave $5 million to support Haley’s campaign, but expressed doubts this week in an interview with   about the future of her candidacy. \"Her poise, admirable; her foreign policy experience, tremendous; her ability to unite this country, phenomenal,” Griffin said. “I just don't know, though, that at this moment, that's going to get her where she needs to get to in South Carolina and thereafter.” The Democratic National Committee moved South Carolina ahead of New Hampshire on this year’s primary calendar in part in a bid to galvanize Biden’s base of Black voters in subsequent primary contests. The New Hampshire Democratic Party refused to recognize the move, however, and proceeded to hold its primary in conjunction with the GOP contest last week. Biden, siding with the DNC, opted not to appear on the ballot, and the DNC penalized the state by removing its delegates. Local volunteers with the Biden write-in effort ran a grassroots campaign, largely consisting of ads and mailers, encouraging voters to pen his name on their ballots."

    "title": "How Ozempic Maker Novo Nordisk Is Tackling Weight Loss Drug Shortage This Year",
    "content": "Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk will boost supplies of its wildly popular obesity drug Wegovy in the United States this year, mitigating—but likely not ending—shortages as it   but struggles to meet growing demand while expanding into new markets. Wegovy injector pens are authorized to help people with obesity.  Novo Nordisk “started gradually increasing” supplies of lower doses of Wegovy in January, the company   Wednesday, months after it throttled provisions to “safeguard continuity of care.” The company will more than double the quantity of lower doses reaching the U.S. compared to recent months, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters in a call discussing the firm’s stellar  . Novo Nordisk will also gradually increase overall supply of the anti-obesity drug throughout the rest of 2024, the company confirmed to Forbes in an email. In its  , the drugmaker said it is exploring other ways to shore up scarce supplies of in-demand medicines, adding that it has invested nearly $11 billion in expanding global production capacity. The company said it is also “thinking strategically” about how to remove bottlenecks from its supply chain, singling out disposable auto-injector pens patients use to deliver Wegovy and other medications in its catalog. In particular, Novo said it is exploring ways to reduce reliance on “single-use injection devices,” such as introducing medicines in once-weekly, rather than daily, formulations. Novo Nordisk throttled distribution of smaller Wegovy doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients. As the drug has a risk of gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, patients are started on a smaller dose that is then increased over time to reduce any risks. The restrictions, which are still officially in place after the announcement on boosting supplies, meant many new patients could not begin treatment. Jorgensen said the increased supplies mean more U.S. patients will be able to start treatment. Novo Nordisk has been struggling to meet booming demand for Wegovy for years. The drug scored regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2021 and it has been featured on the Food and Drug Administration’s shortages list   early 2022. For much of this time, Wegovy, the brand name for a GLP-1 hormone-mimicking drug semaglutide, was the only anti-obesity drug of its kind on the market and its   has pushed Novo Nordisk to secure record profits and become one of the most valuable companies in Europe. Semaglutide’s weight-loss properties have also contributed to   of another of Novo’s blockbusters: Ozempic. Ozempic also contains semaglutide but is licensed to treat diabetes, not obesity, but as it is authorized clinicians can and do prescribe it for other purposes “off label.” The U.S. is  in struggling to secure supplies of the popular drugs and   there and around the world have warned demand is helping   for counterfeits and trafficked goods. Illegal sales can be dangerous and have none of the rigorous safety guarantees pharmaceutical firms must adhere to during production, sales and shipping, such as the sterile conditions required for injected medicines. Some patients in Austria and Britain have been   after using products that may have contained insulin instead of the advertised semaglutide. 50 million. That’s how many people with obesity should be able to get healthcare coverage for Wegovy in the U.S., Novo Nordisk  . Around 10 million would access this through Medicaid and 40 million through commercial coverage, the company said. It estimates there are around 110 million adults living with obesity in the country."

    "title": "Inside Saudi Arabia’s $800 Billion Tourism Moonshot",
    "content": "hatever your preconceived notion of Saudi Arabia as a travel destination is, it’s about to be get a major renovation. Imagine Sindalah, for example, a   with three ultra-luxe resorts, 38 high-end restaurants and multiple superyacht marinas. Or Qiddiya, a   of 600,000 people rising from the desert floor, dedicated to esports and gaming. How about Trojena, a space-age   built above the high desert? Or The Red Sea, a   of 50 luxury resorts and 8,000 hotel rooms spread across 22 islands in a Maldives-style archipelago—powered entirely by wind and solar energy? Also in the works is The Rig, a   built on an off-shore oil platform. In addition, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a major cruise destination, with   having recently bought a $300-million ship. Across the Kingdom, new roads, airports, golf courses and cruise terminals are rising from the sand. The map is literally being redrawn in real time. Then there are all the new hotels, with their thousands of freshly built rooms. The world’s most iconic hospitality companies—Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, St. Regis, Fairmont, Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and InterContinental—are falling over themselves to jump into a construction pipeline that’s churning faster than anywhere else in the world. Any one of these projects might momentarily pierce the travel industry’s fleeting attention span. But together, what’s going on in Saudi Arabia simply cannot be ignored. Indeed, it can be often difficult to visualize the vastness of Saudi Arabia’s physical transformation. Some of the most notable ongoing projects—including Sindalah, the 7-star private island, and Trojena, the improbable desert ski resort—fall within NEOM, a $500-billion built-from-scratch region in northwest Saudi Arabia where the Kingdom is creating new cities, resorts and other developments. At 10,200 square miles and bounded by the Red Sea to the south and the Gulf of Aqaba to the west, it’s roughly the size of Albania. Fantasy Island: Sindalah will feature 88 villas, 333 apartments, 51 luxury retail stores and an 86-berth superyacht marina. Bankrolled mainly by the Kingdom’s $700-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the idea for NEOM was born out of  , Saudi Arabia’s grand plan to shake off its historic reliance on oil and diversify its economy. One of the scheme’s pillars involves reinventing the country as a global tourism juggernaut. When first announced in 2016, the Kingdom’s tourism goals seemed fanciful: Attract 100 million foreign and domestic visitors to the country every year and grow tourism’s share of the economy from about 3% to 10%. Oh, and do it all in just 14 years. That aspiration seemed all the more preposterous given that, in 2016, Saudi Arabia had not yet opened its doors to international leisure travelers. At the time, travel to the Kingdom was almost entirely restricted to three types of people: expatriate workers, those with business visas, and religious pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Then in 2019,   it would provide e-visas and visas on arrival to visitors from 49 countries, including the United States. Among other changes announced at the time: Female visitors would be exempted from wearing an abaya, the traditional and otherwise obligatory head-to-toe robe, in public places and would be allowed to travel without a male companion. Tourists would still be required to dress modestly and Mecca would remain off-limits to non-Muslims. Since Saudi Arabia opened to the international travel market, the speed and spare-no-expense approach to its transformation has stunned even the most seasoned tourism analysts. “We’re seeing hugely ambitious plans, huge amounts of development,” says Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism research at  . “Billions, ultimately trillions, worth of dollars being invested in infrastructure and in diversifying their economy.” The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated the Kingdom has already spent $800 billion, and that doesn’t include the massive amounts of foreign investments pouring in. The pandemic delayed some projects, of course, but rather than scaling back expectations, the Saudis ratcheted up their goal to 150 million annual visitors by 2030. Here’s where semantics come into play. In tourism parlance, a “visitor” is defined as someone who visits a site within the country, which is very different from what Euromonitor deems an “arrival,” someone who makes an overnight stay. (Other organizations sometimes call the latter “tourists.”) Saudi Arabia had over 24 million foreign arrivals in 2023 and will welcome nearly 37 million in 2030, according to Euromonitor projections. “So if each of those 37 million overnight tourists visits three sites, you pretty much have got your 100 million visits,” Bremner says. “Then add on top of that your domestic tourists, and their own set targets are quite achievable.” A more meaningful measure of success is how much foreigners are expected to spend while in Saudi Arabia. Euromonitor predicts that international tourists will spend $38 billion in 2030. But the total economic impact for Saudi Arabia will be far greater after adding in domestic travelers’ expenditures and the ripple effect of one million new tourism jobs. The WTTC projects that, by 2032, Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector could contribute nearly $169 billion to its GDP, representing 17.1% of the total Saudi economy. Waterworld: The Red Sea Global project features several luxury resorts, including one with overwater bungalows. “Remember, they’re building this destination on the ledger, essentially from scratch, for the international market, and they are bringing in the best of the best in terms of the quality of people they’re working with” says Bremner. “I can see that they’ve thought through every single aspect of tourism, from the staff to the product, the brand, the service, the connectivity, the sustainability. So it really does feel like they’re building something for the next century ahead.” Preparing for the future also means recognizing the seismic shift in what the next generations of global travelers will want. Roughly 90% of young Chinese travelers and 70% of Gen Z travelers in the UK, Australia and India say they are looking to discover new destinations, according to data from  . In that sense, being the new kid on the tourism block is an enormous plus. “New generations have a lot more information through social media,” Billy Canellas, head of asset management at NEOM,   at the Skift Global Forum East in December. “[Younger travelers] are very well educated about the effects of overtourism in traditional destinations,” he added, noting “a clear tendency towards the eco-friendly and sustainable destinations” and an eagerness to learn about a destination’s “culture and the traditions of diversity.” “The luxury market is getting more diverse and younger, and it's shifting to the emerging markets,” says Bremner, noting that the United Arab Emirates, India and China are all highly appealing to this demographic. “We have this fresh-faced luxury traveler, and it's not the traditional older generation of travelers with lots of money. It’s the New World luxury traveler, highly digital, very environmentally conscious, and for whom social impact is important.” “Make no mistake,” says Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, “what Saudi Arabia is doing is they’re identifying who are some of the most important travelers are—the people willing to spend a lot of money on experiences—and asking, How do we go get them?” There are, of course, many ways for the Saudi grand vision to go sideways. First, there are enormous financial risks inherit in tackling so many giga projects all at once, even for a country with bottomless pockets. “The Saudis are running at 82% public debt compared to government revenue,” Bremner says, noting that official public debt as a percentage of GDP was 23.8% in 2023. Still, it’s all relative. The Kingdom’s debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly double what it was a decade ago, but still quite low compared to other countries. For example, Switzerland’s government debt is 41% of GDP. The U.S. and Canadian governments’ debt is 133% and 106% of GDP, respectively. The U.K.’s debt is 98% of GDP. Bremner’s biggest concern is hotel overcapacity, which would ultimately suppress prices. “That luxury positioning is going to come under a little bit of erosion, because [the Saudis] are moving so quickly. With that level of supply, it is quite hard to balance,” she says, adding that Euromonitor International’s latest forecast model predicts that the average traveler’s spend will have already dropped by 2030. “Too many hotel rooms that aren’t being filled will drive prices down, so that’s a risk.” Sand Dollars: A new Four Seasons is a part of Red Sea Global and will have 149 rooms and suites, a spa and an 18-hole golf course. In addition, Saudi Arabia has a persistent PR problem among many would-be travelers, especially those from the West. The Kingdom still has strict laws about drinking and severe restrictions for women, not to mention allegations of human rights abuses and attacks against journalists. In 2021, the U.S.   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of   journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But any concerns about human rights haven’t stopped multinational corporations from investing in the Kingdom’s grand vision. “For some players, it will be a very important issue, perhaps a complete barrier to entry,” says Bremner. “However, we can see that the majority of luxury hotel brands have already shifted from China and the U.A.E. into Saudi Arabia.” After all, the international travel market loves nothing more than a shiny, new destination in an emerging market and right now, the Middle East is having a moment. “You have the Middle East in the sort of perfect location,” says Bremner, “just like Turkey—within a five-hour flight of Asia and of Western Europe.” Even with the start of the Israel-Hamas War last October, the Mideast was nevertheless the fastest-growing tourism region in 2023, with international arrivals 23% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the  . That’s 35% above the global average, as the rest of the world’s tourism is, on average, still at a 12 point deficit compared to 2019 visitor volume. While just over three million American tourists visited the region in 2023—making up 12.6% of total outbound U.S. tourists—that’s a massive 39% jump from 2019. And though the Middle East’s portion of American tourists was smaller than those of Europe (40%) and Asia (15.7%) last year, it was the only one of the three regions that has grown since the pandemic, according to data from National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO), the agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks tourism statistics. But Freeman isn’t concerned about Saudi Arabia’s ability to lure large numbers of American tourists. “I'm worried about them trying to attract Europeans, high-spending Middle Easterners, and Asians, who might have otherwise come and spent their money in the United States,” he says. After all, Freeman says, international tourism is an increasingly competitive sport where one country’s gain is another’s loss: “What gives us pause,” he says, “is that other nations now realize that travel is a global competition to figure out who can attract the customer.”"

The Apple logo is displayed at the Apple Store June 17, 2015 on Fifth Avenue in New York City.  Apple shares closed at $188.04 on Tuesday, continuing a consistent decline the company’s stock has experienced since Jan. 24, when it closed at $194.50. Tuesday’s 1.9% drop outpaced the decline of the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which declined just shy of 0.8%. Tuesday’s drop came amid the report from TF International Securities that predicted iPhone shipments will be trimmed down to about 200 million units this year, a 15% decrease year-over-year. The report attributed the figures to a supply chain survey that indicated “Apple lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments” of key semiconductor components—electronic pieces used in devices from phones and computers to vehicles and televisions. TF International Securities also claimed smartphone maker Huawei’s return in the Chinese market, alongside rising popularity of foldable phones, will contribute to the shipment decline. A lack of “significant design changes” with new iPhone models will also harm Apple’s shipping momentum, at least until 2025 at the earliest, the report added. Apple didn’t immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. Apple will report its fourth quarter and annual earnings Thursday, with analysts expecting 0.6% revenue growth from last year to $117.9 billion, according to  .  as the most valuable public company earlier this month and continues to maintain a higher market capitalization ($3 trillion) than the iPhone maker ($2.9 trillion).

    "title": "Adidas Shares Fall After Conservative 2024 Projections—But Company Plans To Sell Leftover Yeezys To Buffer Hit",
    "content": "Adidas shares slumped sharply Thursday morning after the company’s conservative projections for 2024 fell short of analyst expectations, as the company continues to deal with the fallout of severing ties with Kanye West. Adidas shares plummeted on Thursday after the company's cautious projections for 2024. Adidas’ share price plunged nearly 9% after markets opened in Europe on Thursday, before settling at $178.5 (165.44)—down 6% from the previous day. In its preliminary   for 2023, the company projected an operating profit of roughly $540 million (€500 million) for 2024—  of analyst estimates of around $1.37 billion (€1.27 billion)—because of currency fluctuations in key markets. The sportswear giant is attempting to soften the blow as it plans to sell its remaining inventory of Yeezy footwear, valued at around $324 million (€300 million), at cost, instead of writing it off, from which it expects to generate around $270 million. For 2023, the company reported an operating profit of $289 million (€268 million)—sharply down from $772 million in 2022 but significantly better than the company’s previous forecast of a $108 million loss. $1.08 billion (€1 billion). That is the total hit on revenue the company says it faced in 2023, owing to unfavorable currency fluctuations, including a “severe impact from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso at the end of the year.” The company reported net sales of $23.1 billion in 2023. During the company’s earnings call, Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden referred to the cautious projections for 2024 as a “worst-case scenario” and said: “Everything we are saying is conservative.” Gulden added: “We're trying to be humble, and down-to-earth, and then rather surprise you positively than negatively.” In 2022, Adidas joined several major brands in severing ties with Kanye West after the rapper made several antisemitic remarks on social media and interviews.

    "title": "Will Trump’s Criminal Charges Hurt Him In The Election? Polling Suggests Yes—But It’s Unclear If Cases Will Go To Trial In Time.",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "title": "Trump Calls Central Bank Digital Currency ‘Very Dangerous’—After Vowing To Prohibit Fed’s ‘Digital Dollar’",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump expressed heavy skepticism about the security of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which he has vowed to block, in an interview released Friday, though he personally owns   in cryptocurrency himself, according to Forbes’ estimate, and hawks a line of NFT trading cards. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after  Trump said a so-called “digital dollar” would be “very dangerous,” claiming it could create a situation where money suddenly disappears from people’s bank accounts, he told Fox News in response to a question about his plans to block the Federal Reserve from formally issuing a digital currency. The statements echo a similar claim Trump made in New Hampshire last month, where he told a crowd he would “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.” While Trump has his own personal investments in digital currency, he was critical of the industry during his presidency, calling it “highly volatile,” though Republicans’ have proposed crypto-friendly regulations and Trump, if re-elected, is likely appoint regulators who would be more aligned with digital asset firms than the Biden administration, which is largely skeptical of the industry. The Federal Reserve has not expressed a definitive stance on digital currency, but has been exploring the possibility amid the explosion of private crypto and concerns that it could morph into an unregulated currency system outside of the federal government’s purview. Trump pivoted to artificial intelligence in responding to the question about digital currency in the interview, calling AI “maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything, because there is no real solution,” he said in a preview of the interview, set to be released in full on Sunday. “The AI as they call it . . . is so scary,” he said, referencing a fake speech he recently saw of himself promoting a product he “never endorsed.” Trump, in his New Hampshire speech, likened the creation of a central bank digital currency to a form of “government tyranny,” warning it would give the federal government the ability to “take your money.” The Biden Administration issued a 2022 executive order that ordered government agencies to develop policy recommendations and a potential framework for regulating digital assets. The process for developing a central bank digital currency could take years, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last year, emphasizing that it has not made a decision on its feasibility and is still assessing the public’s appetite for such a system, which would require approval from Congress and the executive branch, Powell said. In his New Hampshire speech, Trump credited his former opponent, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for warning him of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency. Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa primary and endorsed Trump, is among the names being floated as Trump’s potential running mate pick, as he is all-but-certain to clinch the GOP nomination, potentially as soon as March. Ramaswamy has also said a central bank digital currency would create “a mechanism for the government to be able to wipe out your bank account, wipe out your dollars if you say or do something the government disapproves of” calling it “a threat to liberty in this country.” Eleven countries have established a central bank currency, citing plummeting cash usage, increased accessibility, lower infrastructure costs and improved security. More than 100 countries are currently exploring the option."

The settlement involving Publicis Health, a subsidiary of France-based  , was the result of a “coalition” co-led by James composed of “every attorney general in the nation,” according to a news release from her office. The agency worked with Purdue Pharma   on marketing campaigns for a number of opioids, namely “OxyContin, Butrans and Hysingla,” and used strategies that were “designed to deceptively expand” opioid usage for more patients at higher doses, the release stated. Negotiations for the settlement, which requires Publicis to pay the amount within 60 days, were led by James and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, according to the release. The advertising agency is also prohibited from “accepting any future contracts or engagements” involving opioid marketing or sale, and is required to release “hundreds of thousands” of internal documents related to its work with manufacturers and consultants. More than $19 million of the settlement will go to New York to “fund opioid abatement, treatment, and prevention,” according to the release.

    "content": "British Formula One star Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes at the end of the upcoming season and is set to join Ferrari in 2025, according to    , in what could be one of F1’s biggest moves in nearly a decade. Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

    "title": "Trump Georgia Election Prosecutor Admits ‘Personal Relationship’ With Fani Willis—But Denies Wrongdoing",
    "content": "Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade confirmed a “personal relationship” with District Attorney Fani Willis for the first time Friday, as Willis fights a push by former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants to have Willis thrown off the Georgia election interference case over the allegations. ulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appears before Judge Scott McAfee for a hearing in the  Wade acknowledged he and Willis “developed a personal relationship” in 2022, after he was appointed special prosecutor, in an affidavit filed Friday as part of Willis’ response to Trump and his co-defendants’ motion to have Willis disqualified from the case. Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

    "title": "Steele Dossier: London Judge Dismisses Trump Lawsuit Over ‘Perverted Sex Act’ Allegations",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s lawsuit against a former British spy over allegations Trump bribed Russian officials and engaged in “perverted” sex acts was   by London’s High Court on Thursday, the latest legal blow for the ex-president who will likely battle President Biden in the November election. Former President Donald Trump's lawsuit against Orbis was thrown out by a judge in London.  Judge Karen Steyn   Trump’s claim against Orbis Business Intelligence over a   it compiled that alleged Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election, bribed Russian officials and took part in “perverted sexual acts” in Russia that gave Moscow material with which to blackmail him. Trump’s lawyers had argued the dossier—which came to light days before he took office—contained false, inaccurate or fabricated information about the former president and sought damages from the company for allegedly violating British data protection laws. Steyn, in a written ruling, said there are “no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed” as Trump had “chosen to allow many years to elapse -– without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction.” There is a six-year period of “limitations” that such damages need to be claimed within, Steyn reasoned, adding that the former president’s claim for damages “is bound to fail.” Steyn, who said she did not consider or determine the veracity or accuracy of the dossier’s claims, noted that the “only other remedy” Trump sought—an order to erase, or restrict processing, of his data—was “pointless, and unnecessary,” as Orbis had already deleted its copies of the dossier and it is “freely available” online anyway. In a   of the ruling, the court said Trump had “no real prospect of obtaining any of the remedies he sought.” Buzzfeed News set Washington ablaze in early 2017 when it published a   filled with scandalous allegations about Trump and his purported links to Russia. The dossier was compiled by Orbis founder Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent who   the British intelligence agency’s Russia desk and whose name is now inextricably linked with the report. The consultancy claims it had not been the one to make the “Steele Dossier” public and Trump has repeatedly denied its findings. The report was   commissioned by Hillary Clinton’s Democrats and other Trump opponents. On the last day of his presidency, Trump declassified testimony from Steele about the former president’s links to Russia. Steele, who is British,  the decision as “reckless” and in October claimed two Russian sources had not been heard from since. Steyn said she thought Trump’s real purpose for pursuing Orbis was not for damages but as a final attempt at rehabilitating his reputation after failing for years through other means. “In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility,” Steyn wrote. Orbis had   Trump brought the claim merely to air “longstanding grievances” against the company and Steele.  (CNN)  (BBC)"

    "title": "Trump’s 2024 Legal Cases: Here’s When The Ex-President Could Go To Trial This Year—As Jack Smith’s Election Case Gets Delayed",
    "content": "Pending legal cases against Former President Donald Trump are expected to come to a head this year, as the ex-president faces the possibility of four criminal trials alongside multiple civil cases—though the ex-president’s federal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election has already been delayed, and it’s unclear how many cases will go to trial before voters go to the polls. Former President Donald Trump gestures as he wraps up a campaign event on December 19 in Waterloo,  Trump’s January was already filled with a number of court appearances, as closing arguments took place in the   against him and his company, and he went to trial against writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against him—resulting in a jury   Trump to pay her $83.3 million. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear   in Trump’s challenge of a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that disqualified him from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, which stands to have ramifications nationwide as voters in numerous other states also try to kick Trump off the ballot. Trump was scheduled to go to trial in the   against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, brought by special counsel Jack Smith—but the case has gotten delayed waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges, and it was   from the court’s calendar, with presiding Judge Tanya Chutkan now scheduled to oversee other trials starting on March 18 and April 2. Trial is scheduled to start in the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal case against Trump in state court, which   him of falsifying business records in conjunction with “hush-money” payments made to women during his 2016 campaign—and is so far expected to proceed as scheduled. Trump is slated to go to trial in the federal   against him for allegedly mishandling White House documents that he brought back to Mar-A-Lago, though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March, and the judge has already   several deadlines, which likely makes it harder for the trial to proceed on time. Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney Fani Willis has   this as the trial start date in her   against Trump and his allies for trying to overturn the 2020 election—but it’s unclear whether it actually will be, as no final trial dates have yet been set. The cases against Trump carry the possibility of significant penalties against the former president, including prison time. Trump could be sentenced to up to   in prison if he were convicted of every criminal count against him and given the maximum punishment, though that’s unlikely to happen. He could also be fined up to   in the criminal cases against him, plus whatever damages he’s ordered to pay in civil cases. The ex-president also faces more legal challenges in which a trial date hasn’t been set yet, with civil lawsuits   from Capitol police officers and Democratic lawmakers that seek to hold Trump liable for Jan. 6 and lawsuits still pending across the country that challenge Trump’s candidacy under the 14th Amendment. How the pending cases will affect the 2024 election. It’s still hard to say how the Supreme Court could rule on the 14th Amendment issue—and whether their ruling would only affect Colorado or other states—and it’s still hard to predict how many of Trump’s criminal cases will be decided before either the presidential primary wraps up this summer or the November general election. The federal election case can only move forward once the federal appeals court rules on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges—though once it does, the trial is expected to be further delayed by Trump appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court. Trump has tried to delay the trials against him until after the 2024 election, particularly given that in the federal cases against him, getting reelected would mean he could appoint prosecutors willing to drop the charges against him. Even if Trump does get convicted before the election, it still wouldn’t necessarily thwart his chances of becoming president, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from being in the White House—though recent   suggests swing voters could be dissuaded from voting for him. Trump has strongly denied the charges and civil allegations against him, pleading not guilty to the criminal charges against him and declaring cases against him to be a “witch hunt” designed to harm his presidential candidacy. The ex-president has also continued to push false claims of election fraud despite facing repercussions for trying to overturn the 2020 election,   on Truth Social in January he “did nothing wrong” and was “bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without question, Rigged and Stolen.” 56%. That’s the share of U.S. adults who believe Trump is “probably guilty” of a criminal conspiracy stemming from his false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland   released in January. That includes 88% of Democrats but only 18% of Republicans. A smaller 46% believe Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack should disqualify him from the presidency, as the 14th Amendment cases against him argue. Trump faces 91 total criminal charges in the four criminal cases against him, which were all brought in 2023 as yearslong investigations into the ex-president wrapped up and ended with indictments. Trump’s pending legal cases come after the ex-president already began to face legal consequences in 2023, including being found liable for defaming and   Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. Though he hasn’t issued his final verdict yet in Trump’s civil fraud trial, New York Judge Arthur Engoron also ruled ahead of the trial that Trump and his co-defendants—including his sons—are   because they misstating the value of their assets on financial documents, which the state alleges was done to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. Engoron ordered Trump’s business certificates to be canceled as part of that ruling, though an appeals court has put that on hold while the order gets appealed.

The convoy kicked off its multi-state journey in Virginia Beach on Tuesday, and is encouraging “active and retired law enforcement and military, Veterans, Mama Bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media, and LAW ABIDING, freedom-loving Americans” to join on the road. Organizers told the   at least 700,000 people would attend the rallies—but   reported only about 50 cars, trucks and RVs joined the convoy as it drove into Dripping Springs, Texas, on Thursday, noting the group is hoping to add more drivers has seen supporters cheer them on from the side of the highway (    reported seeing just a few dozen vehicles at other stops). The group has raised about $157,000 on donation platform   (it is unclear what Take Our Borders Back plans to spend the money on, and has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy insists it will not be “going to the border,” instead simply touring the border states—though one of its major rallies is scheduled to take place at the Cornerstone Children’s Ranch, a farm located just along the border in Quemado, Texas. At least one elected official, Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas)m told local news outlets he planned to attend one of the rallies, telling   in Dallas-Fort Worth the convoy “should be a peaceful movement by the American people” (Self has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy is planning three large rallies in border states on February 3: one in Quemado near Eagle Pass, Texas, one in Yuma, Arizona, and one in San Ysidro, California. “We are ready to roll into these peaceful assemblies in three cities … and we’re going to hold elected officials accountable,” organizer Scotty Saks said in an announcement video posted on alternative video hosting site Rumble. “Our borders and language and culture are being destroyed by this open border policy … We have solid ground for doing this event.” “God’s Army” is already facing internal friction,   reported on Wednesday. According to the report, multiple tires were slashed on convoy drivers’ cars while they stayed overnight at a hotel, and a person was kicked off one of the convoy’s buses and left on a highway shoulder. Convoy organizers seem to be blaming this on “individuals and groups actively spreading misinformation and lies” from inside the organization itself. “We have some legitimate intel from multiple sources that infiltrators, provocateurs plan to attack our convoy—either on the road or at our events,” Saks said in a video post on Rumble. Saks did not provide any direct evidence of these infiltrators, but said any potential instigators will face “the wrath of the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets who will be on the ground at our event.” The convoy comes as the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate Washington. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico are at an all-time high, after agents 2.4 million encounters over the course of 2024—up more than 4% from 2022, and more than 40% from 2021, according to  . The massive influx of migrants has overwhelmed CBP and the asylum system, which Republicans blame on President Joe Biden’s border policies, though Biden has denied claims of lax border enforcement and blamed the crisis on larger factors like poverty and violence in Central America. Eagle Pass, one of the towns the convoy is preparing to drive through, has become a focal point for migrants crossing the border into Texas, eventually compelling the state government to seize control of a local park and begin installing razor wire along the border. The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration was allowed to remove the razor wire, but Texas officials have since declared they will not let the federal government access the park and will keep installing wire. Last week, Biden endorsed a bipartisan bill that would give him the authority to shutter the southern border if crossings exceed a certain threshold and hire more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to more quickly process the massive amount of migrants in the region. In exchange, the bill would authorize more military aid to Ukraine—a major priority for Democrats. Despite the fact that the bill has not yet been released, President Donald Trump and House Republicans have begun attacking the proposed legislature, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) telling his colleagues the bill was “likely dead on arrival.” This week, the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who they accuse of violating his oath of office by not enforcing border security. The committee advanced the articles early on Wednesday morning, which could lead to a full House vote on the secretary’s impeachment."

    "content": "The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani Willis on Friday, over allegations Willis’ office planned to misuse federal funds and fired a whistleblower—as the Fulton County prosecutor faces scrutiny after bringing racketeering charges against former President Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the   demanding documents from Willis’ office, citing a whistleblower allegation that Willis’ office “planned to use” a nearly $500,000 federal grant earmarked for a youth empowerment and gang prevention program to instead “cover frivolous, unrelated expenses.” The allegations are unrelated to Willis’ criminal case against Trump, which accuses the former president of illegally trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Jordan claimed in a letter to Willis that the district attorney failed to comply with multiple House committee requests for documents on her use of federal grant money, though Willis’ office has   those, arguing in a letter last fall that the requests are an unconstitutional “Attempt to Interfere” with state criminal cases. The subpoena comes as Willis faces allegations she used federal grant funding for MacBooks, other “swag” and “travel,” and that her office fired an employee who had attempted to prevent the office from allegedly misusing federal grant funding, the right-wing   reported. Willis criticized the allegations against her as “false,” claiming the employee was “terminated for cause” and that the grant funding has been “focused on helping at-risk youth and seeking justice for sexual assault victims.” Willis has been ensnared in a separate divorce case involving one of her lead Trump prosecutors for several weeks, as well as in a case brought by one of Trump’s 18 co-defendants accusing her of violating conflict of interest laws. In a court filing last month, Trump co-defendant Mike Roman alleged Willis violated ethical standards by engaging in a clandestine relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to the Trump case.   presented in the divorce case revealed Wade and Willis took trips together to the Caribbean and Napa Valley in 2022 and 2023, which Wade paid for. Willis has not denied the relationship with Wade, though she has rebuffed a separate subpoena in the divorce case,   in a court filing that Wade’s wife, Joycelyn Wade, had been “obstructing and interfering” with Trump’s RICO case in an attempt to damage her reputation. Willis reportedly plans to argue she has not broken any laws requiring her to step down from the case, sources told   on Thursday. Willis was   earlier this week to testify at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on whether she should be removed from the racketeering case for allegedly violating conflict of interest laws. Georgia Republicans, meanwhile, have launched a state   into Willis over the allegations, while multiple state GOP members have called for Willis to be  . Trump was indicted last August on   in Fulton County, including charges of racketeering, solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, over his alleged role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election—Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied any wrongdoing. Still, Willis has faced wide-ranging GOP backlash after she   against Trump, with Trump labeling the case a “witch hunt” and state Republican lawmakers calling to convene a legislative session last year to remove Willis from office—Republican Gov. Brian Kemp   that bid. The House Judiciary Committee   into Willis’ office in August on claims her office used federal funds or coordinated with federal prosecutors in her office’s prosecution of Trump and his 18 co-defendants—Jordan then sent Willis a letter weeks later asking for information.

    "content": "Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings for 2023, propelled by a tsunami of demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs as new treatments emerge and compete for a slice of the growing market. Sales of Wegovy, an injectable prescription weight loss medicine, has helped boost profits for Novo  Novo Nordisk reported $33.7 billion of sales for 2023, an increase of 36% at constant exchange rates and beating analysts’ expectations. Full-year operating profit also exceeded analysts’ expectations, climbing 44% at constant exchange rates to $15 billion. Diluted earnings per share rose 52% to 18.61 Danish kroner ($2.7). Around 90% of the drugmaker's overall sales—$31.2 billion—came from its obesity and diabetes care division, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively authorized to treat diabetes and obesity. Sales of GLP-1 diabetes medications—a class that includes Ozempic—and in obesity care were largely responsible for this uptick, Novo Nordisk said, rising 52% and 154% at constant exchange rates, respectively. Novo Nordisk shares rose around 4% during early trading on Wednesday morning. \"We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. “Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.\" The stellar success of Ozempic and Wegovy—both branded drugs containing the same active ingredient, semaglutide—has rapidly propelled Novo Nordisk into a rarified club of extraordinarily valuable companies and triggered an acknowledged   for a company of its size. It now has a market value of around $480 billion, up from around $310 billion at the start of 2023, $250 billion at the start of 2022 and around $160 billion at the start of 2021.

Officials there are  over the country’s reliance on a single firm and   into the same trap as Finland when it hitched its wagon to erstwhile phone giant  . Semaglutide mimics the action of a hormone—GLP-1—that is responsible for regulating appetite and blood sugar. It has been shown to help facilitate weight loss and studies suggest it could bestow other health benefits in areas like heart and kidney disease as well. While it is far from the first drug shown to reduce weight, it does not appear to be accompanied by the same litany of often serious side effects as previous generations of weight loss drugs. Experts have therefore hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity, one of our era’s most pressing public health problems. For several years, Novo Nordisk has been the sole provider of GLP-1 generation of weight loss drugs and it has heavily struggled to meet booming demand. It was recently   by Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound injections—a branded name for tirzepatide, the same ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro—are also expected to become bestsellers.

    "title": "Taylor Swift At The Super Bowl: The Conspiracy Theory, Explained",
    "content": "Gamed: Right-wing influencers believe that Travis Kelce—and by extension Taylor Swift—reached the  At some point, Taylor Swift transcended into one of those celebrities who isn’t just famous, but scarily famous; she’s not a brand, she’s an industry. Swift’s extraordinary level of fame, success and influence has provoked the suspicions of reactionary influencers and conspiracy theorists. In conspiratorial online spaces, nothing ever just happens — big things are planned, and Swift’s boyfriend is going to the Super Bowl. Swift is currently dating football star Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, inspiring her fans to take a keen interest in the NFL. Swift attending her boyfriend's games   of conservative commentators who believe that Swift’s media buzz is distracting from the sport. More recently, it has lead some to believe that her presence is part of a convoluted political plot. Swift has been frequently and heavily criticized by conservative commentators ever since the singer spoke up in support of abortion-rights and accused former President Donald Trump of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism\"   (Twitter). Last year, Sean Davis, CEO and co-founder of conservative web magazine The Federalist wrote \"Taylor Swift is dumb and her music sucks\" on an X post that linked to   titled “Taylor Swift’s Popularity Is A Sign Of Societal Decline.” Political commentator Tomi Lahren gave Swift a backhanded compliment on her podcast, stating: \"Her lefty, liberal braindead political opinions aside, I am a fan of Taylor Swift and I have been since way before she went full liberal.\" Kelce previously sparked right-wing   after participating in an ad for Pfizer vaccines; conservative pundit Charlie Kirk   Kelce should be “shamed and humiliated,” while conservative influencers the Hodgetwins   that the NFL star had “sold his soul to Pfizer.” Conspiracy theorists were emboldened when Fox News   baselessly asserting that Taylor Swift is a Pentagon “psy-op” used for political messaging. Not long after, the Kansas City Chiefs secured their place in the Super Bowl following Sunday’s AFC victory, meaning Kelce’s game will likely be attended by Swift. Hence, right-wing influencers came to the conclusion that Swift’s presence at the Super Bowl is by design, with the intent to secure the election for Joe Biden through Swift’s high-profile endorsement at the winning game. The X account “EndWokeness” posted a picture of Swift on several magazine covers and wrote: “What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic and natural. It’s an op. We all feel it. We all know it.” Conservative influencer Benny Johnson used the same picture to emphasize the same point, in a reply to his own post asserting that the NFL was rigged. Johnson  : “Taylor Swift is an op. It’s all fake. You’re being played.” Former “anti-woke” presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy   a more complete version of the theory, prompting affirmations from other conservative commentators. Laura Loomer   that “the Democrats’ Taylor Swift election interference psyop is happening in the open… They are going to use Taylor Swift as the poster child for their pro-abortion GOTV Campaign.” Far-right conspiracy theorist Rogan O’Handley had the most dramatic take — O’Handley wrote a post to the San Francisco 49ers, begging them to beat the Kansas City Chiefs to prevent the death of “millions” and secure “the fate of the free world.” From an outsider’s perspective, Swift’s explosive rise to superstar might seem rather baffling — in some sense, Swift resembles MrBeast, a celebrity who has catapulted themselves to an unprecedented level of fame and influence through their carefully cultivated image, but doesn’t seem particularly charismatic to those outside the fandom. At Swift’s level of fame, the attention snowballs, with the media increasing coverage of Swift as she grows more popular, and fans obsessing over her every move. Not everyone will get Swift’s appeal, but the cumulative effect of her fame isn’t hard to understand — it’s just the market at work. Really, the conspiracy theory seems to have been forged in fear; it’s an acknowledgment that Taylor Swift’s voice holds power, possibly enough to sway the needle. Last year, an Instagram post from Swift encouraging her fans to vote sparked results — NPR   a whopping 1,226% increase in voter registrations the hour after she posted. The funny thing is, Swift is not a particularly outspoken celebrity when it comes to politics. \"Part of the fabric of being a country artist is don't force your politics on people,\" Swift explained in the 2020 documentary  . \"Let people live their lives. That is grilled into us.\" Years ago, Swift was very careful to keep her political opinions to herself (in fact, conservatives   she was secretly a Trump supporter). Like the majority of  , Swift leans liberal. In 2018, Swift was more politically outspoken, urging her fans to vote against Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who was running for Senate at the time. On Instagram, Swift cited Blackburn’s voting record as evidence that spoke for itself: \"[Blackburn] voted against equal pay for women,\" Swift wrote. “She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.\" Blackburn won that election, despite Swift speaking out against her. But Swift’s instinctual rejection of conservative culture war issues aligns with the views of her fans; Gen Z’s   and   is well-documented. Other than speaking out for abortion rights and calling on her fans to vote, Swift has not been politically active in the last couple of years. Swift did endorse President Joe Biden in 2020, and according to  , the Biden campaign is actively courting Swift’s endorsement again, and they’re open to suggestions — one idea was even to have President Biden make an appearance on Swift’s Eras Tour (hopefully, he won’t refer to Taylor as “Britney”  ). Rigging the Super Bowl, however, seems like a tremendous amount of effort to win that endorsement. The theory is especially absurd when one considers that the Taylor Swift conspiracy is mainly touted by influencers who believe the last election was rigged (if President Biden holds the power that conspiracy theorists believe he does, one wonders why they bother to vote at all). Swift might not endorse President Biden this time around — she might not even have time to make the Super Bowl. But for conservative influencers, Swift’s mere presence at the stadium seems threatening. Perhaps she reminds them that their culture war is a losing battle."

    "title": "Trump Has Racked Up Nearly $40 Million In Legal Fees Since His First Indictment",
    "content": "Trump’s criminal and civil cases cost him nearly $40 million in legal fees in the months since he was indicted for the first time in March 2023, according to filings from his leadership PAC Save America, as the ex-president used donor funds last year to battle cases that are only set to escalate before the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event on Jan. 27 in Las Vegas.  Trump’s leadership PAC Save America—which is paying the bulk of the ex-president’s legal fees—spent approximately $53 million between March 30, 2023, the date of Trump’s first  , and the end of 2023, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $38.9 million of that money   specifically on legal consulting and other legal-related services. That compares to $25.2 million that was   on legal consulting between Nov. 2020, when Trump first formed the PAC in the aftermath of the 2020 election, and March 29, 2023—with $8.4 million of that   during the first three months of 2023, right before the first charges against Trump were brought. Trump’s largest legal payments went to Christopher Kise, who represents Trump in his   and his criminal case for retaining White House documents, and Kise’s legal associates, with Save America paying Chris Kise & Associates $3.3 million and Continental PLLC, a law firm employing Kise and other lawyers representing Trump, $3.6 million between March 30 and December 31, 2023. Other attorneys representing Trump in his criminal cases were paid by Save America PAC, records show: Attorneys at Blanche Law, representing Trump in multiple criminal cases, earned $2.3 million; John Lauro, representing Trump in his federal election case, earned $2.6 million; Georgia election case attorney Steven Sadow took in $1.5 million and Susan Necheles, Trump’s lawyer in his Manhattan “hush money” case, earned $950,555, among other payments. Trump attorney  ’s firm Habba Madaio & Associates, which represents Trump in cases including his civil fraud trial and E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against him, was paid $3.2 million, while Dhillon Law Group, representing Trump in 14th Amendment cases seeking to disqualify him from the ballot, took in $579,408 in payments through Save America and additional payments through Trump’s campaign. Save America’s legal-related fees also include other payments, such as more than $900,000 to NYU accounting professor  , who appeared as an expert witness at Trump’s civil fraud trial, and   in May to a vendor holding ex-attorney Rudy Giuliani’s electronic records, in order to help the former mayor pay his debts. Save America has $5.1 million   as it goes into 2024, when Trump is   criminal trials in potentially all four of the cases against him. He faces two federal trials, one for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining classified White House documents after leaving office, as well as a trial in Manhattan for “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign and a state case in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts. (The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.) Trump has also already faced a civil trial against writer E. Jean Carroll so far in 2024, as well as the end of the fraud trial against him and his company, and will go to the Supreme Court next week to challenge a Colorado ruling kicking him off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment. It won’t be known how much Trump has spent in 2024 so far until the PAC’s next filing with the FEC later this year. Save America raised $52.3 million in 2023, according to its FEC  , with most money coming from either small-money donors or transfers made from Trump’s Make America Great Again PAC and the Trump campaign. Online donors to Trump’s campaign are told 10% of their donation will go toward Save America. Hotel magnate Robert Bigelow—who previously made a $20 million   to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ now-terminated campaign—told   Tuesday he donated $1 million to cover Trump’s legal fees “a few weeks ago.” The New York Times   it’s unclear where that money is actually going, however, given limits on PAC donations that only allow sums of up to $5,000. That means Bigelow couldn’t simply donate $1 million to Save America, the Times notes, and the donor and Trump campaign haven’t offered any clarity on where the funds are being directed. Campaign finance experts told Forbes that Trump using PAC money to pay his personal legal fees is a “highly questionable” legal gray area, though one that Trump can likely get away with. While campaign money isn’t allowed to be spent on personal expenses, the FEC has ruled that doesn’t apply to leadership PACs like Save America. But Dan Weiner, former FEC counsel and director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Elections and Government Program, told Forbes that paying Trump’s legal fees could still constitute an illegal contribution to Trump’s campaign, although Weiner noted the FEC “does not have a history of aggressively enforcing the law when there’s any sort of gray area,” and the Justice Department is unlikely to prosecute unless there’s evidence Trump knew the spending was illegal. “Because of lax enforcement, we have this kind of ‘Wild West’ campaign finance landscape, where there are a bunch of rules, but they are so unevenly enforced that people don’t have a good sense of what they can and can’t do, and that’s obviously a breeding ground for pushing the envelope,” Weiner said. Trump’s remaining rival in the GOP primary election, Nikki Haley, has pointed to the ex-president’s ballooning legal fees to attack him as a candidate. Trump “can’t beat Joe Biden if he’s spending all his time and money on court cases and chaos,” Haley   Tuesday, after the New York Times   on Save America’s legal spending prior to the FEC report being filed. On top of his payments to lawyers, Trump also faces the growing issue of having to pay out high-dollar amounts in his civil cases. A jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll   for defaming her on Friday, and New York state Judge Arthur Engoron is set to issue a verdict in the coming days in Trump’s fraud trial, which   in him having to pay up to $370 million plus interest. The payments could take a significant hit on  , as Forbes   the ex-president had $426 million in cash and liquid assets as of September. While Save America’s $5 million in cash means it couldn’t meaningfully help pay off those debts, it remains to be seen if Trump will try to use any part of his campaign funds on the damages awards, or try to raise funds through his PAC in order to pay them. “I don’t think it’s legal for the PAC to pay the damages award, but I worry that his lawyers will take the position that it can,” Weiner told Forbes. “There’s enough gray area that they might feel they have enough legal coverage to proceed.”  (Forbes)  (Forbes)  (Forbes)"

Those concerned about Swift’s arrival in Las Vegas “can be Fearless” knowing she can “wow Japanese audiences” before she returns to the U.S. to support the Chiefs while “wearing Red,” the embassy said. FlightAware spokesperson Kathleen Bangs told   Swift making it to the Super Bowl is “certainly doable,” adding she could probably make it to Las Vegas within 10 hours because Tokyo’s time zone is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas—giving her more than a full day to jet from Tokyo to Sin City. Swift regularly uses the Falcon 900LX and   private jets, which would be able to cover the 5,530 miles between Tokyo and Las Vegas   to refuel. Though Swift may be able to arrive in time for the Super Bowl, it’s possible there won’t be enough space for her private aircraft to park, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson   the Associated Press, as all 475 parking spots at the four airports surrounding Las Vegas are likely full for the game. Even if Swift can make it back stateside in time for the Super Bowl, it’s not clear whether she actually plans to go to the game. Heidi Hayes, a spokesperson for the Clark County Department of Aviation, told the Associated Press private plane parking around Las Vegas previously reached max capacity in November when the city hosted the inaugural Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Swift has made several appearances for Chiefs regular season games and recently attended the team’s conference championship victory over the Baltimore Ravens, often sitting in a luxury box with Kelce’s mother Donna. Speculation has intensified in recent days over whether she could make an appearance at the Super Bowl—which features the Chiefs against the San Francisco 49ers—and support Kelce, as Swift is   to appear on stage in Tokyo the night before. The concert is scheduled to start at about 8 p.m. local time before ending around 11:15 p.m., or around 6:15 a.m. PT,   to NBC News. A Department of Defense spokesperson told   on Friday that Swift is not part of a “psychological operation” tied to the agency, rejecting   Swift and Kelce are part of a Democratic Party-led plan to boost President Joe Biden’s election campaign.

    "content": "As former President Donald Trump’s high-profile Georgia election interference case becomes increasingly overshadowed by his co-defendants’ conflict of interest allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, eyes have turned to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor in the Trump case whose relationship with Willis has put him at the center of those allegations. Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, has been accused of having an improper relationship  Willis hired Wade in 2022 to prosecute the criminal case against Trump and 18 co-defendants on charges of racketeering, violation of oath by a public officer and conspiracy to impersonate a public officer over Trump’s alleged scheme to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden—Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. Since his hiring, however, Wade has faced accusations that his experience did not qualify him for the lead prosecutor position in the Trump case, with Trump co-defendant Michael Roman arguing in a lawsuit against Willis that Wade’s “lack of experience” does not meet Fulton County standards “given the complexity of the charges.” Before joining the prosecution in Fulton County, Wade worked as a prosecutor and later as a judge in suburban Cobb County handling low-level criminal cases, the   reported, citing “scant evidence” of his record prosecuting major cases and no evidence of his work on a major political corruption case similar to the one Trump faces in Georgia. Wade’s record as a prosecutor primarily involves criminal defense and personal injury cases,     reported, while his law firm,  , lauds him as a “zealous advocate” with experience representing clients after major car accidents and contract disputes. Wade, who graduated from John Marshall Law School in Chicago (now part of the University of Illinois at Chicago), has also served as an assistant county solicitor—a position that handles misdemeanor cases—and   on three occasions for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court between 2012 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, Wade served as an associate municipal judge in Marietta, Georgia—just north of Atlanta—becoming the first Black man to serve as a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb. Since his hiring on the Trump case, Wade has faced criticism from multiple co-defendants, including four defendants who requested a “sanction” against Wade, including his potential “disqualification,” after Wade’s law office sent an unsolicited brochure depicting his smiling face and an advertisement for legal services to multiple defendants just weeks after their indictment in the case, the   reported. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case,   requests for punishment, finding the brochure was not sent intentionally, while admitting it was “embarrassing” for prosecutors. An attorney for Trump co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro also   Wade did not file the necessary oath of office to join the prosecution in a bid to dismiss Wade from the case—McAfee   that argument, saying the oath requirements do not apply to contractors on a single case. Nearly $654,000. That’s how much Wade has been paid by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County  . Nathan Wade was thrown into the national spotlight in the midst of two cases involving his estranged marriage with Joycelyn Wade. The saga began last month when Roman filed a   seeking to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case on the grounds that her “improper, clandestine personal relationship” with Wade constituted a conflict of interest and violated public money laws, with Wade receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. Bank records also revealed Wade and Willis went on at least two vacations together: one to the Caribbean and one to Napa Valley, California. In Roman’s suit, the Trump co-defendant cited sources close to the matter, as well as Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife. The same day Roman filed his complaint, attorneys representing Joycelyn Wade   Willis in the divorce proceedings, with Willis set to testify at a hearing on Wednesday. That hearing, however, was abruptly canceled when Nathan and Joycelyn Wade agreed to a   to resolve their divorce. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee   Willis as part of a separate investigation into allegations her office planned to misuse a federal grant from the Department of Justice earmarked for a youth empowerment program. In a court filing on Friday, committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) argued Willis’ office planned to use nearly $500,000 in federal funding from the grant on “frivolous, unrelated expenses,” including on MacBooks and travel costs—Willis denied the allegations. Jordan also accused Willis of firing a whistleblower who reportedly attempted to prevent the funds from being misused—Willis claimed the staffer was “terminated for cause.” After two weeks of accusations, Wade broke his silence Friday morning,   to having a “personal relationship” with Willis in an affidavit filed in Fulton County Superior Court, though he denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with the district attorney. Wade also argued he had “no financial interest” in Trump’s election interference case, and stressed that no income he received as special prosecutor was “shared with or provided to” Willis. Wade’s affidavit was included in a 176-page court filing Willis submitted Friday morning, in which the district attorney rejected Trump’s request for her to be removed from the case, reiterating her argument that the case for her dismissal has no legal merit. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on whether to dismiss Willis from the case. Trump, who has repeatedly targeted Willis throughout his election interference case,   Willis once again in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, claiming she was “able to get her ‘lover’ much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual,” by bringing charges against Trump.

    "title": "Here’s Why Trump Might Sabotage Plan—Backed By Biden—To Close The Border",
    "content": "A much-anticipated crackdown on the southern border that both many Republicans and President Joe Biden support—and which Senate backers say could be voted on this week—might fail just because Donald Trump wants it to, and is pressing his supporters to vote against it. Trump’s campaign of pressure to senators and public criticism at rallies and on social media may  At a   on Saturday night, the former president continued his campaign to scuttle the deal, which he called a “monstrosity,” saying “there is zero chance I will support this horrible open border betrayal of America,” Trump told supporters on Saturday night, without clearly describing his opposition to the bill. Trump has made his ability to solve the border crisis his primary campaign message, and his only clear criticism of the bipartisan plan is that the border deal would also mean “billions of dollars to Ukraine and other countries.” Biden and House Republicans have been in a standoff for months: Biden has sought resuming support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia, while Republicans have withheld that funding until Biden commits to solving the surge in migration at the border. But Trump appears to not want Biden to notch any success—and his pressure campaign appears to be working: House Speaker Mike Johnson called any bipartisan Senate bill “likely dead on arrival” on Friday, instead   to Republican colleagues that he would continue to support the GOP’s “Secure the Border Act” which failed to get any Democratic support when it was introduced in May. In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately said he would still support the Biden-backed bill, while admitting Trump’s criticism has put Republicans in a challenging position,   reported. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the lead negotiators, told   on Sunday they were “finalizing the last pieces of text right now” and preparing to present the bill on the floor as early as next week. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), called Trump’s actions “appalling,”   that “he does not want us to solve the problem at the border, he wants us to lay the blame of the border at Biden—and the idea that someone running for president would say ‘please hurt the country so I can blame my opponent and help my politics’ is a shocking moment.” “I notice a lot of the Senators… they’re blaming it on me,” Trump said at his   on Saturday. “I said ‘that’s ok, please blame it on me, please.’” 2.4 million. That’s the number of total migrant encounters recorded at the southern border by Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, according to Republicans on the House  . At his rally on Saturday, Trump claimed “two million illegals crossed the border every single year in the past, and now that number’s changing to maybe eight times that amount,” but the data presented by the committee states that agents only encountered about 3.2 million total migrants across the country last year. On Sunday morning, House Republicans unveiled the text of two new   against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which they plan to introduce to the House Homeland Security Committee next week. Mayorkas has faced   from congressional Republicans for his handling of the border, and faced two impeachment hearings earlier this month. The newly released articles accuse Mayorkas of violating his oath of office by “willfully refus[ing] to comply with numerous detention requirements spelled out by the Immigration and Nationality Act.” The White House has maintained that there is no compelling case against Mayorkas. The DHS also circulated a   criticizing the articles of impeachment, accusing Republicans of “ignor[ing] the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas.” The articles are expected to vote along party lines and advance the articles to a full House vote on Tuesday,   reported. In a rare move on Friday, President Biden   of the bipartisan deal to pass sweeping immigration reform measures, allowing the Department of Homeland Security to close the southern border after they encounter a daily average of more than 4,000 migrants over the course of a week. The bill also provides funding for thousands of more border patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges to handle the ongoing surge, as well as 100 “cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl,” according to the White House. However, many specific details of the bill have not yet been released, including any amount of aid promised for Ukraine should the bill pass. Biden has called thebill a “win for America.”"

    "title": "Why Conspiracy Theorists Think Taylor Swift Is A Pentagon ‘Psy-Op’",
    "content": "Screenshot from the Jan. 9, 2024 episode of the Fox News show featuring Jesse Watters alleging  Have you heard the claim that musician Taylor Swift is a secret “psy-op” used by the Pentagon to influence public opinion? It was a claim largely relegated to conspiracy theorists on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, before Jesse Watters did a segment about the idea on Fox News on Tuesday. But the Fox News segment takes a viral video wildly out of context. Watters played a clip from a NATO conference, but didn’t give any necessary context to his viewers about what they were watching. And Watters seems to think Swift’s popularity in itself is a sign of some dark forces pulling strings behind the scenes. “Have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?” Watters asked viewers after rattling off Swift’s accomplishments on Tuesday night in a segment first flagged by  . “Well, around four years ago, the Pentagon psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset during a NATO meeting. What kind of asset? A psy-op for combatting online misinformation,” Watters told viewers. Watters then played a heavily edited clip of a presentation given by an academic, suggesting there was some nefarious reason Swift and her music are so popular. “Yeah, that’s real. The Pentagon psy-op unit pitched NATO on turning Taylor Swift into an asset,” Watters continued. But what’s actually going on here? Something much more nuanced and less sensationalistic than what Watters is telling his audience. The woman in the clip, Alicia Marie Bargar, was giving a presentation about research she’d conducted with her team at Johns Hopkins University about how information spreads online. Bargar was presenting at the 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict, organized by NATO in 2019, though she’s a civilian and has no known contracts or relationship with the U.S. military. Bargar is an academic who was simply presenting her research at a conference on how information travels through social media. The entire presentation from 2019 is  , and it’s clear from the introduction that Bargar’s presentation is about hypothetical scenarios for how information can be manipulated. Bargar uses Taylor Swift as an example clearly because she’s the biggest pop star in the world right now. “The first one, and the most common [example of influence], is working with famous people or influencers to share information of a particular message. I include Taylor Swift in here because she’s a fairly influential online person, I don’t know if you’ve heard of her,” Bargar said jokingly. Bargar goes on to explain that Swift was standing next to a sign promoting voting in the most general way possible. The image from the presentation is a screenshot from an Instagram post showing Swift waiting in line   to vote. “Celebrities, at least in the U.S., regularly will post pictures of themselves with an encouragement for people to go vote, and this has a measurable effect on voter turnout,” Bargar said in her 2019 presentation. Instagram post by Taylor Swift from 2016 telling people to go out and vote. That’s it. Bargar wasn’t saying that anyone should use Swift as a way to influence public opinion on any given topic, just that she’s an example of a famous person with influence who once gave a generic “go vote” message to her fans on Instagram. And by watching the full presentation you can see how Watters stripped all the nuance and context out of what his viewers were watching, instead presenting a very distorted and intellectually dishonest argument. The way Watters tells it, this was a NATO “meeting” where people were just floating ideas about how to turn Taylor Swift into a tool for propaganda against the American public. In reality, it was a conference where an academic presented research about the flow of information and gave Swift as an example of someone with influence because she’s literally the biggest musician on the planet right now. There’s absolutely no evidence that the U.S. government or anyone else is using Swift as a tool of spreading misinformation, as Watters continually suggested on Tuesday. Watters didn’t stop there, though. The Fox News host brought on  , a former FBI agent, to elaborate on all the spooky hypotheticals about how Swift would indoctrinate the country’s youth to vote for Joe Biden. Again, this is all speculation with virtually nothing grounded in reality. The video of Bargar’s full presentation is quite interesting, showing how researchers are able to identify various threats, like social media accounts associated with the terror group ISIS. Bargar also notes during her presentation that her influence operations are often inspired by how public health messages operate, a subject that was obviously less controversial in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic would become a political football. However, Watters didn’t draw attention to the nuances of that research. Rather, he built the segment around the idea that major music figures would be trying to brainwash kids. Swift has long been thought by relatively fringe elements to be a psy-op. After   magazine named her person of the year near the end of 2023, chatter about how she would be “weaponized” in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election got louder, with allegations that Swift fans are zombies who can’t think for themselves. “Taylor Swift has a cult-like following that would drink poisoned Kool Aid for her. The media knows this and is feeding it,” the X account known as End Wokeness tweeted roughly  . “Music. Entertainment. Sports. Now they crowned her Person of the Year. The next step? Politics. If you don’t think the regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024, you clearly have not been paying attention,” the account continued. End Wokeness may be seen as a fringe voice online, but none other than Elon Musk, the owner of X, has frequently engaged with the account’s content. And that’s how many of the stranger conspiracy theories online now find their way into the public discourse, eventually landing on mainstream channels like Fox News. Call me crazy, but if I was going to run a psychological influence operation with a major celebrity, I probably wouldn’t produce a video about that exact possibility. I’ve reached out to the Fox News media office for comment about Tuesday night’s segment and will update this post if I hear back."

Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory.

But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

    "content": "Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade confirmed a “personal relationship” with District Attorney Fani Willis for the first time Friday, as Willis fights a push by former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants to have Willis thrown off the Georgia election interference case over the allegations. ulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appears before Judge Scott McAfee for a hearing in the  Wade acknowledged he and Willis “developed a personal relationship” in 2022, after he was appointed special prosecutor, in an affidavit filed Friday as part of Willis’ response to Trump and his co-defendants’ motion to have Willis disqualified from the case. Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump   on Truth Social Tuesday night he could replace his legal team as he appeals writer E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against him, after a jury ordered him to pay her $83.3 million—and his current attorney Alina Habba was repeatedly chided by the judge at trial and threatened with   for claiming he was biased. Lawyer Alina Habba (R) looks on as former President Donald Trump attends the third day of his civil  Trump was   to pay $83.3 million in damages for defaming Carroll based on statements he made in 2019 denying her allegations of sexual assault, as he claimed the writer wasn’t “my type.” Trump intends to appeal the verdict, and said on Truth Social Tuesday he and his team were “in the process” of interviewing “various law firms” to represent him as he appeals what he described as “one of the most ridiculous and unfair Witch Hunts our Country has ever seen.” The ex-president was represented at the initial trial by attorney Alina Habba—who also represents him in the   against him and his company, and in other cases—who was   by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan at the trial and had to be reminded of basic courtroom procedures. Following the trial verdict, Habba   with the court alleging Kaplan had an improper bias in the case, citing a New York Post report on his previous work at the same firm as Carroll’s attorney Roberta Kaplan (no relation) that claimed he mentored the lawyer—which legal experts   wouldn’t constitute a conflict of interest that would require him to recuse. Roberta Kaplan denied the claims the judge mentored her as “baseless” in a court filing Tuesday—noting she and the judge had only overlapped at the same firm for two years and never interacted in that time—and suggested she could ask the court to sanction Habba for making the claim, to which Habba then   she was just trying to ask if there was any truth to the Post report and would drop the issue. Habba’s law firm Habba Madaio & Associates and Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung have not yet responded to requests for comment on Trump’s Truth Social post and whether Habba will stay on as Trump’s attorney in the appeal. “Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either ‘CRAZY,’ or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday night. Trump said on Truth Social Tuesday he would “make my decision soon” on his legal representation. It’s unclear when exactly Trump will formally file his appeal in the Carroll case, though it’s likely to come soon after the judge submits a written verdict to the court. The appeal isn’t likely to get the ex-president out of paying the $83.3 million at least for now, however: Trump was previously ordered to pay $5 million in his first trial against Carroll (based on similar but separate statements about her), which he’s had to put into a court-controlled   while he appeals the verdict. Carroll sued Trump in Nov. 2021, accusing him of defamation after he attacked her when she came out with allegations against him, claiming Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. A jury in the first case against Trump—which was brought in Nov. 2022 but went to trial first—found the ex-president liable for defamation and battery, but not rape, and the jury in the most recent trial only had to determine how much in damages Trump had to pay Carroll. They reached their verdict of $83.3 million only a few hours after deliberations began. Habba   as one of Trump’s attorneys in 2021, and while the New Jersey-based lawyer didn’t have high-profile experience beforehand—she previously served as the counsel for a parking garage—she’s become one of Trump’s key lawyers and one of his most outspoken advocates in the press, adopting his combative rhetoric and blasting his political enemies. Her lack of trial experience was betrayed during the Carroll trial, however, when Judge Kaplan had to make such   as directing her how to introduce and mark up evidence and chide her for speaking about materials she hadn’t entered into evidence. Should she now face sanctions in the Carroll case, it would come after she and Trump were previously   to pay nearly $1 million in sanctions in the ex-president’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump continued to attack a Biden-backed bipartisan border deal currently moving through the Senate, declaring on   Saturday in all caps that “A BAD BORDER DEAL IS FAR WORSE THAN NO BORDER DEAL,” as lawmakers scramble to reach a high-stakes agreement on the southern border, which has become an election-year sticking point. President Donald Trump speaks at a roundtable on immigration and border security at U.S. Border  In additional social media statements  , Trump claimed that the border had become “A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION — OUR DESTRUCTION.” His comments come after President Joe Biden issued a   Friday night trying to bolster congressional support for the deal, claiming it would be “the toughest and fairest set of reforms” in U.S. history and vowing to shut down the border with new emergency authorities the day he signs it into law. The fate of a bipartisan border deal in the Senate has been in flux amid criticism from Trump, who on   Thursday said that any senate border deal would be “meaningless” and a political “Gift to the Radical Left Democrats,”   initially casting doubts about whether a deal could be reached. Even if it passed the Senate, the border deal would likely face an uphill climb gaining support from congressional Republicans who back Trump—House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)   told colleagues in a letter this week that the deal would be “dead on arrival.” The border is a key issue for both Trump and Biden—likely set for a rematch in November for the presidency if current results and polling in the Republican primaries hold. Republican s of the Biden administration have centered on the border amid record surges of migrants and an ongoing   between state and federal officials in Texas, where state authorities blocked Border Patrol access to a portion of the border near Eagle Pass earlier this month. Trump has taken a hardline approach to immigration and has  on securing the border. The Senate deal   would, among other things, allow the Department of Homeland Security to turn migrants away during peak migration periods and is also linked to emergency aid to Ukraine. 302,000. That’s how many migrants U.S. border authorities encountered along the southern border in December, the highest tally in a single month ever recorded,   ABC."

    "title": "Amazon’s Flawed Password System Leads To More Stolen Packages",
    "content": "Amazon couriers are exploiting flaws in the one-time password system  An Amazon security system designed to ensure expensive items are delivered to the correct person is still backfiring on customers, 18 months after flaws in the system were first exposed. In July 2022, I   was being used to deny customers refunds for packages that were never delivered in the first place. The OTP system requires customers to give couriers a six-digit code before expensive items are handed over by the courier to the customer. But I reported on multiple cases in which customers who gave the correct code to the courier weren't given the expensive item, often when the person was receiving multiple packages at the same time and didn’t notice the expensive item was missing until the courier had left. Amazon customer support initially refused to refund affected customers, claiming that supplying the code was proof the expensive item was delivered. Since that July 2022 report, I’ve received a steady stream of complaints from customers who’ve experienced a range of problems with the OTP system. Tim Furdi from London has twice suffered as a consequence of Amazon’s OTP system. On the first occasion, a courier arrived at his London apartment to deliver a robot vacuum cleaner. The driver called Furdi when he arrived to deliver the package and said he needed the OTP to release the package to the concierge in his apartment block. But when Furdi went to collect the package from his concierge, no parcel had been left. “The driver was still there and he was adamant that he gave the parcel to reception, but reception denied that he had,” Furdi told me. “Then the driver became verbally abusive and left. I had to call Amazon many times about this and it took three weeks of internal investigations and checking footage before they refunded me.” Furdi had further OTP problems when he recently ordered a router. This time a driver arrived with a package and asked for the OTP, but after handing Furdi the parcel he “immediately realized it wasn’t mine, it was someone else’s,” Furdi said. The driver returned to his van to supposedly retrieve the correct package, but instead drove off. When Furdi contacted Amazon’s customer support he was told that “since I gave him the OTP there's not much they can do, they won't refund or redeliver.” The company has since fully refunded Furdi. It seems rogue couriers have found other ways to beat Amazon’s OTP system, too. Another reader contacted me to complain that their Google Pixel phone had supposedly been delivered while they were out, without ever giving the OTP to the driver. The reader claimed that in cases when the customer is unable to provide an OTP, courier drivers can instead use digits from the customer’s cell phone number as proof of identity. Amazon doesn’t provide drivers with the customers’ phone numbers, but drivers can call customers using an Amazon system where the number is hidden. In this instance, the call went through to the customer’s voicemail, which has a generic message stating “you have reached the answerphone service for” and then proceeds to read out the customer’s number. The driver allegedly used these details to bypass the OTP security system and steal the package. Amazon customer services refused to offer a refund, claiming the delivery was confirmed by OTP. , where the courier rings them and tricks them into giving them their phone number, again using this to bypass the OTP and keep the package, which they know will contain an expensive item. “We work hard to understand the circumstances around every case and find a resolution with the customer. Customer satisfaction is our utmost priority, and we’re sorry that customer experiences in these cases did not meet the high standards we expect,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “We have implemented additional controls that are already making it even harder for bad actors to defraud customers, selling partners and Amazon. We are collaborating with the authorities, and are working tirelessly to improve the customer experience in these cases.”"

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Will Have Key Design Omissions, Insider Claims",
    "content": "When the iPhone 16 series arrives this fall, almost certainly, it may have two glaring omissions which could lead to less stellar sales, a new report claims. Not only will there be no “significant design changes” but one key driver of sales, generative AI, is not going to arrive at scale on the iPhone “until 2025 at the earliest.” Apple iPhone 15 Pro. How different will the iPhone 16 series be? Does this seem right? Well, it could be, because the report comes from one of the most reliable analysts out there, Ming-Chi Kuo from TFI Securities. Kuo’s   claims that Apple has “lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments of key upstream semiconductor components” by 15% compared to the year before, adding that this could mean “the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024.” Kuo claims that this is down to, “a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design.” Kuo goes on to explain that this is because when people are choosing pricey cellphones, they are now looking at two different elements, AI and foldables. But hold on, you say, we weren’t expecting a foldable iPhone, but isn’t AI coming to the iPhone this year? There certainly have been strong rumors that Apple will announce big changes to iOS at WWDC in June, and it may even be the biggest update ever. But Kuo says that Apple “will not launch… the more comprehensive/differentiated GenAI ecosystem/applications until 2025 at the earliest.” Let’s put this a bit more positively. If it’s right that big AI changes are coming to iOS 18, as predicted, then hold on to your hats for what’s coming next year. Kuo also claims that there will be a “continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,” because of the preference for a foldable phone at the premium end of the market, alongside “the return of Huawei”, the brand which had been flailing since restrictions on international product sales were placed on it, but has seen a resurgence in the last few months. How much will the next iPhone design differ from this one? The report also says “Apple will not launch new iPhone models with significant design changes,” again, not until 2025 or later. Of course, there have already been reports of new updates to the iPhone 16 range. These include  , wider implementation of the exceptional  , a new strategy for its  , more advanced  , noticeably  , a new thermal design to  , improved  , a new microphone   an  , designed for shooting video and an improved  . I mean, that’s quite a list, and you may feel that if all the above are delivered, that they add up to significant design changes already. And it’s only February! Plenty more leaks could appear before the fall. Again, if Kuo reckons that 2025’s improvements will be on a much bigger scale than this year’s, then I can’t wait."

    "title": "Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds Long-Term Review: Refined Excellence",
    "content": "Sony WF-1000XM5 case The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds have been my travel companion for the past two months now. There’s plenty to like – the sound, the battery life, improved active noise cancelation (ANC) and a more compact design. While comfort and fit remain subjective, Sony has introduced some significant changes, but not all of them translate to a better experience. I had one prominent issue with the Sony XM4 earbuds – the size. That’s because it felt too big to fit in my pockets alongside the phone. Sony has worked on it and reduced WF-1000XM5 dimensions, so it’s noticeably smaller and much more portable, which I love. The difference is more noticeable when you open the case because the earbuds have been shrunk too. As per the company, the earbuds are 25% smaller than the predecessor, and 20% lighter. If you have used the XM4s, you’d be delighted to put in the XM5s in your ears because they no longer feel bulky. It’s a significant improvement in design but not in material used. The matte and glossy finish looks classy but the glossy finish on the earbuds’ sides causes issues. In my time with the XM5s, there have been zero (okay, almost zero) instances where I was able to take out the earbuds from the case in one try until I figured out the correct way of plucking them out. Push-and-pull the earbuds instead of pulling with two fingers You need to push and pull with a thumb and finger instead of pull with two fingers to get them out of the case. The glossy material provides no grip, so if you have sweaty or greasy fingers, you are going to struggle with them unless you use the thumb method. Ideally, taking out the earbuds and putting them in your ears should be a natural, seamless experience, but it isn’t on the Sony WF-1000XM5. The earbuds come with proprietary foam tips. You get four of them in the box, including extra small, small, medium and large. If you put them in and realize that the ANC isn’t effective, that’s because these tips don’t work like silicone tips. You need to insert and twist, so they expand to seal the ears and perform as intended with ANC on. You can always swap them for silicone eartips if the new foam material doesn’t feel comfortable to you. Like before, the XM5 earbuds are rated IPX4 for sweat resistance. The Sony WF-1000XM5 comes equipped with all-new 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X, which is larger than the 6.4mm found on the XM4s. According to Sony, this helps reduce mechanical noise, which is hard to notice. The earbuds support SBC, AAC and LDAC codecs. For Android phones, LDAC offers better sound but isn’t enabled by default on all the devices, so be mindful of turning it on. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbud The Sony XM5 earbuds bring in more clarity and dynamics. I enjoyed listening to songs that have acoustic guitar or piano playback with vocals being clear. The earbuds sound more open than before. While the XM4 had more thumping bass response, these sound more controlled, detailed and overall better in lower frequencies. The treble is more refined too. All of this is with ANC on, but turn the noise cancelation off, and you’ll get a more natural sound. The WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature six microphones, a bone conduction sensor and a noise reduction engine with AI machine learning to offer a better calling experience than before. I was thoroughly impressed with the call quality and wind reduction tech. These are some of the best earbuds for calls. You can also use head gestures (can be toggled in the Headphones app) to accept or reject calls. But they don’t work 100% of the time. You can choose from Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa for voice assistance. I set up Alexa and making hands-free calls by saying the trigger word and command worked eight out of 10 times. The new Sony earbuds feature a new integrated processor V2 and HD Noise Canceling processor QN2e that work together to bring top-notch ANC performance. I’ve been on a few flights, and these have been my go-to earbuds for travel because these the ANC doesn’t give a vacuum-like effect that could make your ears uncomfortable. It’s right up there or even a notch better than AirPods Pro 2’s ANC but I prefer Apple’s transparency mode. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds case back In terms of features, you get dynamic head tracking, which is cool to have but I prefer having it off. The app offers a quick optimization process to fine-tune the head tracking, which works with Netfix and YouTube to offer a more immersive experience. The Sony XM5 earbuds support multipoint connectivity so you can connect to two devices simultaneously. It works flawlessly. Other Sony-exclusive features like Speak-to-Chat and Adaptive Sound Control are present too. The latter controls the amount of ambient sound to push in your ears depending on where you are and what you’re doing. For instance, you can have ANC off when you’re moving. Notably, it requires your location data to work. One of the worst parts of non-stem earbuds design is that you are limited by controls because there’s only so many things you can do with a few taps. But on the XM5s, you can customize them for play/pause, ANC modes and volume – all at the same time, like the  . For reference, the XM4s didn’t let you operate all three together, and you could only choose two out of these three functionalities. The Sony WF-1000XM5 can last up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, while the charging case adds another 24 hours of playback time. You get wireless charging support and fast charging that can give you an hour worth of battery life with a three-minute charge. I didn’t find myself out of charge when needed. The battery life is better than the AirPods Pro 2 (six hours). Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds in black The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature a new design that’s smaller, lighter and more comfortable than before. There’s a minor inconvenience that you can make peace with because you get rich, clear and immersive sound and call quality. The ANC performance is top-class too. The Sony WF-1000XM5 remain the earbuds to beat in terms of sound, features and ANC. At $280 / 24,990 INR, these are an easy recommendation for Android users. These perform well with the iPhone too but AirPods Pro 2 offer a more seamless experience."

    "title": "How Stock Outs Or Shortages Affect Private Healthcare And Consumers",
    "content": "Pharmacist checking the shelves with a digital tablet Essential medicines are drugs that the World Health Organization has deemed crucial for a population to have reliable and regular access to. Many of these are life saving drugs. However, in the low and middle-income countries, “stock outs” of these medicines are very common. The stockout rates at public health facilities are estimated to be as high as 33%. There are even higher rates observed for specific classes of medicines, such as drugs for HIV-positive patients as well as for treating malaria. It is important to note that the precise number of stockout rates depend on specific countries and time periods. For patients, the absence of drugs can mean prolonged illness, disrupted treatments for chronic conditions, increased rates of morbidity, and even deaths; all that could have been avoided. When public supplies dwindle, patients are often forced into the private sector, where the costs are markedly higher. In Uganda, for instance, during stockouts the price of antimalarial drugs can surge by 35%. As demand spikes in private facilities due to public shortages, those who can least afford it face steep prices. Consequently, some patients opt to forgo treatment entirely. Furthermore, there is also the cost of time and hassle as patients go across multiple health facilities in hopes of getting treated. Overall, drug shortages work to decrease trust in the healthcare system. Stockouts are also frustrating and demotivating for public sector health care providers in low-income settings, who are unable to appropriately treat patients. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, experience a different set of challenges and opportunities. An influx of patients might can strain resources and inflate prices due to increased demand. This not only affects the reputation of these providers but also raises ethical concerns about profiting from public sector shortcomings. Public health facility stockouts send ripples through the healthcare landscape, compromising patient health, adding financial strain, and pressuring private providers. Overall, drug shortages work to decrease trust in the healthcare system. There are numerous initiatives to reduce stockouts by improving supply chain operations and access to high-quality medicines worldwide, such as the Global Fund and PEPFAR. But more work and research is needed to ensure reliable access to medicines worldwide. It's a stark reminder that when one part of the healthcare system falters, the entire network feels the tremors. Ensuring the availability of essential medicines in public facilities is not just about health equity; it's about stabilizing the entire healthcare ecosystem for the well-being of all. — Did you know that drug shortages also happen in the US? Year 2023 saw the highest number of active drug shortages on average (measured quarterly) since 2015."

    "content": "Following an impressive reveal and popular pre-order window, Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones go on sale to the public today. And for those choosing Samsung's vision of smartphones, there are some tempting offers of free and discounted hardware alongside the new phones. Galaxy S24 Ultra on show at Galaxy Unpacked, January 17 2024, London, United Kingdom. The offers are not as wide-ranging as those in the pre-order window, which shouldn't be too surprising. The chance to bump up the onboard storage to the next tier was always going to be the most attractive offer, and hard to beat now the South Korean company is in full retail mode. Pre-orders tend to favor those buying their handsets SIM-free. I'd expect the majority of S24 sales to go through mobile carriers, which have a wide window of discounts they can offer thanks to the two-year-long contracts signed by consumers, allowing the financial impact of any offer to be spread over the 24 months of the contract. Here in the U.K., Samsung has an offer on top of any network or carrier offer. It has a free bundle of Galaxy Buds2Pro and SmartTag 2 for anyone who purchases a Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra from a wide range of networks and retailers during February. These need to be claimed from Samsung within 30 days of purchase. Ordering directly from Samsung U.K. opens up another tier of offers. Those purchasing either the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24+ will receive a 5% discount on their first purchase over £500 in the Samsung Shop App; and a 30% discount on both the Galaxy Watch6 Classic and two years of Samsung Care+. Finally, there’s a 12-month subscription to the Disney+ streaming service. You also have exclusive online colors; Sapphire Blue, Jade Green and Sandstone Orange for The S24 and S24+, and Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, or Titanium Orange for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I think Samsung would like you to know that the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses titanium as a material. As we saw with the pre-orders, the offers have regional variations. Those buying the S24 Ultra handsets in the U.S. can pick up discounts on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Galaxy Watch6 and Galaxy Watch6 Classic. At the same time, Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ owners have discount offers for the Galaxy Buds FE, Watch6 and Waatch6 Classic. Check your local listings for details, and remember that network pricing and offers may vary. Tthe flagship Galaxy S24 at Samsung's flagship store in Shanghai, China (CFOTO/Future Publishing via  Outside of the offers, the U.S. prices for SIM-free handsets—broadly indicative of other regions, are as follows; Samsung’s aggressive offers worldwide should boost sales of the Galaxy S24 family while the company has a short window of advantage. By bringing the launch date forward from the traditional mid-February slot ahead of Mobile World Congress, Samsung has not only a clear run with press coverage, but pre-orders and sales lock people into the handset and ecosystem for the next year or two before MWC highlights countless other premium smartphones. The Galaxy S24 launch is also comfortably clear of the Apple iPhone. The community that always buys iPhones will have made their purchases now, leaving a pool of less committed users to Apple’s vision. Samsung is facing an audience who want a reason to buy. The latest offers are making the Galaxy offer as tempting as possible."

    "title": "Forget The New MacBook Pro, Apple’s Jony Ive Had Something Much Better",
    "content": "Apple’s MacBook line-up is a sprawling mix of Air and Pros, M3s and M2 Maxs, various screen sizes and multiple designs. It’s far from the clean and simple lines the Apple brand promises. Yet there was another way of laying out the various MacBook laptops that would have delivered just that. Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (Photographer: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg) Speaking with   (via  ), long-time tech reporter Walt Mossberg talked about then Apple Design Chief Jony Ive wanting to unify the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines into a single behemoth “MacBook” offering, reasoning that the MacBook Pro could be engineered to be just as thin and portable as the MacBook Air. As we know, that didn’t happen, but the next MacBook Air at this time saw minimal changes, but enough to mark it out as a new product. Apple’s Intel-powered MacBook line-up remained crowded and confused. It’s a problem that Apple magnified when the launch of Apple Silicon paired the consumer-focused M1 chipset into both a MacBook Air case and a MacBook Pro case. The former was clearly a great pairing, but the latter was little more than the MacBook Air with a fan to help cooling; the true MacBook Pro models would arrive six months later with a new design, a choice of 14-inch and 16-inch displays, and the professionally focused M1 Pro and M1 Max Apple Silicon chipset. The M1 MacBook Pro was stranded.. too expensive compared to the MacBook Air and too underpowered compared to the other MacBook Pro laptops. There was a thin argument that you wanted both the Air and Pro brands on show in the move to Apple Silicon, but Apple continued with its Frankenstein MacBook Pro in both the M2 and M3 generations. This brings me back to Ive’s focus on a smaller portfolio offering value at each segment, following the Apple tradition of a good/better/best offering for the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac, and the MacBook. If Ive were to have his way and merge the Air and the Pro into a singular MacBook category, how would the Apple Silicon family have looked? You’d have the entry-level model that delivers for the consumers—which would more than likely be the MacBook with M3, the mid-tier MacBook with M3 Pro, and a top-tier MacBook with M3 Max. Throw in the choice of a 14-inch or 16-inch display, and you have a simplified range which everyone understands and is confident they have the best model for their needs. Instead, Apple has a confusing mess of Airs and Pros, with different markets targeted by similar machines, mismatched steps in both performance and design and a portfolio that feels designed to upsell you to the next model."

For the 21st year of “Our Planet In Focus,” the competition’s prizewinning images show us the highs and lows of , captured through the lenses of talented photographers of all ages, including “lyrically beautiful European agricultural landscapes, heartbreaking shots of elephants searching for food on rubbish dumps, inspirational athletes still competing in their 80s and 90s and photographs capturing the friendship between a rescued pangolin and her carer.” The winners were chosen from more than 20,000 images by amateur and professional photographers of all ages from 150-plus countries. The overall award (below) went to Slovenian photographer AndreJa Ravnak for her depiction of hops growing in Slovenia and her images of rolling fields in Italy and Czechia (Czech Republic) “that combine a fairytale beauty with the structure one might expect from her ‘regular job’ as an architect.” There is a subtle elegance about this year’s winners,” said TPOTY founder Chris Coe. “This comes through in both of AndreJa’s winning portfolios. One takes us into simple landscapes, with delicate colors and a textural beauty, the other into the hop fields, out of season and undressed, ready for the next planting. Neither are obvious subjects, neither photographed at an optimal time of year and yet they are both engaging and rather beautiful.” Travel Photographer of the Year was founded in 2003 and has become one of the world’s leading travel photography awards. “We are enthusiastically documenting this wonderful world, and perhaps this is a small contribution, a reminder to preserve its wonder for future generations,” the new Travel Photographer Of The Year said. The 2024 awards will launch at the end of April/beginning of May with  Overall Winner Early in the spring, the first rains allow wheat to grow in the rolling fields near Pienza, Tuscany in Italy. Due to the cold nights, the landscape is often shrouded in beautiful mists on clear mornings. This agricultural landscape is sparsely populated, with land being used to its fullest potential. Farms are located atop individual hills. Overall Winner Once all the strings are manually stretched, workers ensure that the small hop seedlings start climbing up at Slovenia’s Savinjska valley near Braslovce. When finished, they leave the Savinja Valley for a few months and return in late summer, when the hops are ripe for harvesting. Winner, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A dual shot of a Mobula ray fever cruising below a divers’ boat as part of their annual migration in La Ventana, Baja California, Mexico. Special Mention, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A yellow armadillo, in mid-air, comes galloping down a pathway at a secluded lodge in Brazil’s Pantanal wetlands. Runner Up and Special Mention, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio  Mateo smiles as Marimba nestles into her safe place, tucked under Mateo's chin at the Wild is Life Sanctuary in Harare, Zimbabwe. Marimba, a ground pangolin, was around a year old when her mother was poached for her scales. Marimba was too young to fend for herself and was taken to the sanctuary, where she met her full-time carer Mateo. Pangolins are notoriously difficult to look after in captivity, requiring particular and personal care. Mateo’s gentle nature seemed like a perfect fit and a remarkable relationship was born. Marimba and Mateo have spent 10 hours a day together for the past 13 years and are inseparable. Many attempts have been made to re-wild Marimba, but she always finds a way back to Mateo who refers to her as his last-born child. The Last Embrace, Highly Commended Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio   In Tanzania’s Tarangire National Park, a young female lioness feeds on a dead female elephant. This is a huge feast for the entire pride that will provide them with nutritional intake while the surrounding environment of the national park suffers from draught. For predators, each meal represents a huge and risk-fraught battle. Highly Commended, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A procession of Asian elephants in Sri Lanka’s eastern province weaves through a desolate landscape, designated as a dumping ground for humanity's excesses. The sight is both tragic and emblematic of the Anthropocene, an era where human influence shapes the geological narrative. Amid the discarded remnants of our civilization, these gentle giants unknowingly navigate a perilous course. Plastic waste, an unwelcome intruder, infiltrates their dung and stomachs, a poignant reflection of our collective failure in waste management. The echoes of burning refuse reverberate as millions of tons of waste enter the bellies of both wild creatures and their human counterparts, a heartbreaking testament to our shared vulnerability in this modern age. Winner, Best Single Image, Nature, Wildlife and Conservation Portfolio A discarded glass bottle in the ocean off Anilao, Philippines, has become a ‘crystal palace’ for a small, iridescent yellow Gobby. Winner, Young Travel Photographer Of The Year Fourteen-year-old Caden Shepard Choi won the title of Young Travel Photographer of the Year 2023 for her highly accomplished and well-observed black-and-white story of how the Navajo people of Chinle, Arizona, produce wool and use it in weaving. In this image, a Diné woman works on a rug started by her daughter. The master weaver sits perfectly still, but her hands are in constant motion. She weaves inside a Hogan, a hexagonal structure with a single door that always opens to the east, a sacred place for the Diné people. The woman positions herself in front of the open door to receive the blessings transmitted by the rays of the morning sun. Winner, Young  Photographer ages 15-18 Another young female photographer – 17-year-old Lilly Zhang – took top honors in the Young TPOTY 15-18 years category with a series of delicate landscapes shot in Marsh Creek State Park in Pennsylvania. It was a crisp autumn morning, the mist suspended on the water with the fall colors reflecting on the surface and a great heron perched on a rock by the shore. Runner-Up, Young TPOTY Age 15-18 The wild monkeys of Ifrane National Park in Morocco climb freely on the majestic Atlas cedars in the Moroccan Middle Atlas. The photographer captures the special peaceful, familiar atmosphere of the forest and the life of the monkeys.

Winner, Best Single Image in a Landscape and Environment Portfolio  A delicate image of the ‘submerged forest’ created by reflections in Lake Shirakawa, Japan. At the end of winter, when the lake fills from melting snow, the water changes color between light blue and light green as the mist hangs around the trees and the reflections look like a fantastic landscape. In the soft light before sunrise, the submerged forest quietly welcomes the morning. Winner, People and Cultures Portfolio caategory The image is one of a portfolio of shamans performing rituals on Siberia’s frozen Lake Baikal in Russia. The Buryatian shaman Vitalli performs a ritual to connect with the spirit of the sacred Ogoi (Dragon) cape in the background. Siberia is considered the heartland of Shamanism, with Lake Baikal its most sacred place. Winner, Best Single Image, People and Cultures Portfolio Members of Nigeria’s national amputee football team, the Special Eagles, train on the beach in Lagos. Winner Visual Stories Portfolio   The image is part of a series capturing an alternative view of aging in the 21st century, focusing on athletes in their 80s and 90s participating in the U.S. USAFT Masters Indoor Athletics Championships. Dixon Hemphill rom the PotomacValley Track Club crosses the finish line in the M95 (Men 95-99) 200 meters, accompanied by a young woman for safety. Hemphill is running out of competitions. At 97, it's hard for him to find anyone to race against in the M95 category. Hemphill rediscovered athletics in his seventies. \"I got a medal and thought, well, this is fun. That was 50 years ago, and I've been running ever since.\" He has run hundreds of races including marathons, triathlons, and has held world records, \"but now my body can't handle long races anymore. So these days, my racing distance peaks at a mile.” A Quieter Life, Winner, One Shot category This serene image of a lone walker on a white sand dune at La Puna, Argentina, won the   One Shot category challenging photographers to capture the theme, ‘A Quieter Life,’ in just a single image. Above, Eye Level, Below, Winner, MPB One Shot category This shot offers an unusual perspective of the Highline 197 suspension bridge in Reutte, Austria.

As the last rays of the sun illuminate the iconic Treasury of Petra, a Bedouin enjoys jumping between the overhanging rocks. At sunset, it’s as if the once-lost city has two profoundly different souls divided between day and night. When tourists leave this iconic destination, the Bedouins reawaken the ancient soul of Petra by repopulating the site to eat around bonfires and stay connected to the traditions handed down by their ancestors. Winner, People’s Choice award The People’s Choice award went to a 15-year-old photographer for this image showing a bewildered lone wildebeest in the middle of the frenzy that is the Great Migration in the Maasai Mara.

    "title": "Saturday Conversation: Rob Bisel On Working With SZA And Grammy Love",
    "content": "Musician/producer/engineer Rob Bisel has eight Grammy nods this year for his work with SZA. SZA is the most nominated artist at this year’s Grammy Awards with nine total nods. As the co-writer, producer, mixer and engineer for the album  , Rob Bisel is right there with SZA. For his work with SZA, Bisel has eight nominations this year, including ones for the big three — Song, Record and Album of the Year. Bisel worked as an engineer for Rick Rubin at Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu. Rubin sent Bisel to Hawaii to work with SZA in January of 2020. During that time Bisel and SZA formed a bond that they continued while working together during the COVID lockdown. The result was SOS. Sage Bava and I met with Bisel and his dog Ponzu in his Los Angeles studio to discuss his creative process, his work with SZA, what he learned from Rubin and Kendrick Lamar and much more. Rob Bisel: It's definitely ramping up. There are a lot of events and stuff next week, various parties and mixer things. So, it's starting to get there. Yeah, the buzz is starting to pick up for sure. Bisel: Right, it's super exciting. And it's a good way to set up your next couple of projects. You never know who's going to be there. I have a friend, this producer, Earl on the Beat, and he produced the Doja Cat songs, “Paint the Town Red” and “Agoura Hills.” He said he met her at a Grammy party last year and just struck up a conversation. So, it's good to do the rounds, run into people. You never know what'll come out of it. So yeah. Bisel: Doja Cat would be cool. I don't know though. I'd love to meet a cool new artist that is doing something exciting. There's a good chance to find new talent too. So, I'm stoked to get out there and meet some people. Bisel: I'm trying to do more songwriter-oriented music this coming year. I guess that's not dissimilar from what I've done in the past, but it feels like there's a lot of good music being made by artists that are like writers' writers. Someone like Noah Kahan comes to mind, he's just an A-plus writer. And it's not uncommon anymore for writers of all different genres that can really carry their own weight when it comes to writing a song, which I don't think historically has always been the case. It wasn't uncommon for pop artists to be spoon-fed songs that they had no attachment to. Bisel: Million percent. I think we ran into a brick wall on one end of the spectrum of overly processed program music. Especially I think after COVID too, people want music that makes them feel like they're in a live performance, like in the room with someone else. Not just this alien sort of thing with no soul, no life to it. It's got to feel like it was made by a human. I think those human connections that can be communicated through music sometimes are more important than ever, just cause of where the world is at right now. Bisel: Elliott Smith, for sure. That immediately jumps off the page for me. Every decade, I feel like there would be someone different. But I don't know, when I think songwriters, he's someone that, for me, comes to the top of my mind. But, if I really thought about every decade I could spit out a couple different names for you. Bisel: I've been lucky to work with some amazing artists that can write. I really appreciate that. And I don't take that for granted. I don't think of myself as a crazy songwriter, but I think I'm good at giving perspective and feedback to good writers and helping challenge and poke holes in whatever they're doing, hopefully for the better. So yeah, that's how I see myself fitting into the whole little puzzle there. Bisel: There's a lot of intangible stuff for sure. I love working with people that are down to try everything. I like working with people that are down for \"dumb ideas\" and they'll even give those a shot. It's important for everyone in a creative environment for that to be the case, just cause you don't want to be over-thinking every idea because your dumb idea may end up being the breakthrough genius thing. And if you're in your own head thinking like, “Oh, so and so who's sitting five feet away from me is going to think this is stupid.” You're going to be second guessing and doubting yourself the whole time. This is not a fun headspace to be in when you're making music with people. So, first and foremost, that comes to mind for me. Yeah. Bisel: Something that comes to mind, in terms of production and stuff, is this SZA song, “Low.” The core of the beat is actually that accordion sitting right there, and it's this hard aggressive trap beat. You wouldn't really think of accordion, that wouldn't be your first choice of sounds for something like that. I don't think SZA ever balked at the idea of having an accordion song. The other people that I made that beat with, they didn't ever stop and think, “Why are we doing this?” They were just down to try stuff. That's one thing that comes to mind for sure. Bisel: One thing I work on is being really consistent about making things. I read a really cool interview with Jerry Seinfeld a year or two ago, where he talked about every day he sits down and just writes by himself for one hour. That's all he does. He isn't looking at his phone, jus him, a pad of paper and a cup of coffee. There are no distractions. I try to be habitual about sitting down and making stuff and knowing that even a little voice memo you make late at night as you're going to bed, that could be the core of a song someday. I think I'm pretty good at being able to polish up and get a song across the line. Bisel: Yeah, I learned a ton cause I spent several years working at a studio as a studio assistant and an engineer there. I was an assistant for probably six months on the most recent Kendrick [Lamar] album to come out. I learned so much watching his teamwork. They would make several different versions of every song and they'd record horns on something for a day and then they wouldn't even end up using it. Just seeing the dedication of that team and how willing they were to try a million things even if it almost definitely was never going to see the light of day. And not leaving any creative stone unturned. I'd say that was a really cool experience. I learned a lot from just watching them and I try to keep that in mind as I'm going through revisions of a song or trying alternate versions. Bisel: That's the magic of a song usually. I’m trying to always keep that in mind and protect that at all costs. It's easy to go down the rabbit hole and lose track of that initial spark for something. But I think it's always super important, especially as you're \"finishing\" up a song, to go back and listen to your first version of it or your first demo and just make sure that all these steps you did along the way actually were better. Cause it's easy to trick yourself into thinking, “Oh I put all this work and time into something, it must be better.” But oftentimes it's really not. It's really important to preserve that initial core idea. Bisel: it’s honestly her. It's funny cause I had a handful of people ask me what the gear was, what the plug-ins were, whatever. That stuff helps but it really is her. The best singers, that's always the case. In my days as a studio assistant, I was lucky enough to be in the room with some legendary singers. I was in a session with Neil Young thinking, “Oh, he just sounds like this. It's not like an effect or a mic. That's just Neil.” She has that indescribable quality right out of the gate. I try to do what I can so that when her voice is coming out of the speakers, it's more palatable to her and feels more in line with how she wants the world to hear her. I try not to get in the way and screw things up too much and get too heavy handed with it.   Bisel: Well said. So often people want to put their stamp on a thing. But I had a realization lately that the \"best producers\" almost always are the ones that are just working with the best artists. And if you want to get the best song, just put the spotlight on the artist, don't put the spotlight on yourself. You'll be a better producer for it, and the spotlight will in turn come back to you because you gave the people what they wanted. They don't want you, they want them. Hopefully that doesn't upset too many producers out there, but that's the truth. Bisel: Rick Rubin is an obvious answer there. I learned so much working at his spot in Malibu. I think he's the master of identifying what makes certain artists, unicorns and not getting in the way of whatever takes your breath away by hearing Johnny Cash singing in his later days. Not diluting that in any way, or what makes the Chili Peppers feel untamed."

    "title": "Trump Must Pay E. Jean Carroll $83 Million For Defamation, Jury Rules",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her after she accused him of sexual assault, a jury ruled Friday, ending years of litigation as Carroll has sought retribution for the former president’s attacks on her—and adding to the $5 million Trump has already been ordered to pay her. Former President Donald Trump leaves his apartment building in New York on Jan. 22, to attend his  After a brief deliberation Friday afternoon the jury returned a verdict saying Trump must pay $83.3 million in damages, including a $65 million award for punitive damages and $18.3 million in compensatory damages. Carroll first sued Trump in November 2019, accusing the then-president of defamation after he denied her allegations of sexual assault, claiming Carroll wasn’t “my type.” She filed a second lawsuit in November 2022 alleging defamation and sexual assault, which went to trial first in May 2023, with the jury ruling Trump did assault and defame Carroll—but did not rape her. Given that Trump had already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault—the second lawsuit was based on different but substantially similar comments he made about Carroll—this trial was only to determine damages, and began Jan. 16. Trump has already appealed the verdict against him in Carroll’s first trial, and could likely do the same with this ruling. He’ll still have to turn over the money first, however, as he did in the first case,   the sum into a court-controlled account while the case is being appealed. The ex-president has continued to attack Carroll on social media in recent weeks and months—posting about her   on Monday alone—though it remains to be seen if Carroll has any intention of filing another defamation claim against Trump for his more recent posts. Forbes has estimated Trump’s   at $2.6 billion as of October, with an estimated $426 million in cash and liquid assets. It’s unclear whether he’ll be drawing from those reserves for his payout to Carroll or pay through his Save America PAC, which has been handling the lion’s share of his legal fees—though that group   having only $3.7 million in cash on hand as of June 30. This may be the first of two big payments Trump will be ordered to make in cases against him this month, as Judge Arthur Engoron is also expected to imminently issue a verdict in the ex-president’s separate  . New York Attorney General Letitia James brought that case against Trump and his company, alleging the ex-president and his associates fraudulently misstated the value of assets on financial statements for personal gain. The case went to trial starting in October, and Engoron has said he’ll likely issue his verdict by the end of January. James is   Engoron to force Trump and his co-defendants to pay approximately $370 million plus interest, with the majority of that to be paid by Trump and companies he controls. Carroll first accused Trump in 2019 of sexually assaulting her decades earlier, writing in a   published by New York Magazine that he raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. After Trump attacked her and her allegations, Carroll   him for defamation in November 2019, alleging Trump’s reaction to her allegations caused her “emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.” The case got delayed in the courts for years as Carroll’s second lawsuit moved forward, as Trump unsuccessfully tried to have the first case dismissed because he was president when making the comments about her. Carroll is one of approximately   who has come forward with allegations of sexual assault or misconduct against Trump, but is the only one whose allegations have gone to trial. Former “Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos also sued Trump for defamation after he denied her account of sexual assault, but later   the lawsuit in Nov. 2021. Zervos’ attorney said she stood by her allegations of assault but “no longer wishes to litigate against the defendant.” Trump has denied all the claims against him and has maintained he doesn’t know and didn’t assault Carroll, though U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the most recent trial, said before the case went to trial that he could not make those claims in court, because he’s already been found liable."

    "title": "iOS 17.4: How The iPhone Update That Changes Everything Affects Apps Like Spotify",
    "content": "Apple is about to release a huge update for the iPhone, iOS 17.4, coming in early March. There will be  , but part of it is Apple’s desire to comply with a new EU law, the Digital Markets Act, which comes into effect in March—hence Apple’s timing with its update. It will affect all 27 countries in the EU (the U.S. is only affected by some of these changes, though that could change in the future if the U.S. government follows the EU’s lead). Apple’s response to the EU law is to open up the iPhone software to let external app marketplaces in, while simultaneously trying to keep the iPhone safe from malware and other security issues. But some app developers are up in arms—like Spotify, which called the changes “extortion.” Where does the truth lie? The App Store on the iPhone is about to change.  Under the current arrangements, developers pay a commission to Apple when they charge for their apps or users buy digital goods or services through the app. The DMA was partly prompted by complaints from companies like Spotify, which filed   against Apple in 2019, calling the commission a tax. After Apple announced its new rules, Spotify described them as extortion. Apple responded in a statement: “We’re happy to support the success of all developers—including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice—with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.” Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify. A little background: Spotify stopped accepting premium subscriptions in the app in 2016 to avoid paying commission to Apple. And  , it switched any customers who had signed up for the premium tier to the free, ad-supported service, inviting them to sign up again using a different payment method outside the app. This means that right now, Spotify is not paying anything to Apple for placing the app in the iPhone App Store. Developers of free apps pay nothing to Apple to have their titles in the App Store. Since there are 1 billion iPhones out there, it’s a clever way to reach a huge audience. The market for streaming services is huge and growing fast, with Spotify the leading player. The changes required in the DMA are certainly complex—you can read details of them  . But where it most affects companies like Spotify is in something called the Core Technology Fee. The new rules mean that in the EU there will be options for alternative app marketplaces. These marketplaces can choose to use alternative payment methods. They won’t pay commission from the sales to Apple, but they will pay the CTF ($0.54, 0.5€). That fee is paid on the first annual install, after the app crosses the threshold of 1 million. If your app gets 999,999 installs, you pay nothing, if it’s 1,000,001 downloads in a year, the total owed to Apple is 0.5€. So, what’s the fuss about? Well, if you have 200 million downloads (Spotify’s subscriber number is higher than that), you are suddenly paying very significant sums. If Spotify decides to stick with the current terms, it will continue to pay nothing. But, understandably, it wants to offer its subscribers the most appealing way to switch to premium by signing up and paying in the app. To do that, it needs to pay the commission Apple requires under the current terms or else pay the CTF under the new terms, for example. Apple’s North Star, it says, is the privacy and security of users’ experience. The App Store is very safe, and keeping it that way is not cost-free to Apple. Apple’s view may be that developers like Spotify want access to the huge iPhone audience without recognizing or paying for the value that it brings."

    "content": "If you’ve updated to the latest iPhone software, iOS 17.3, you’ll know that the key new feature was Stolen Device Protection, so if someone steals your iPhone, heaven forbid, and knows your passcode, their ability to get into your digital life or remove you from your phone, is significantly curtailed. Now it’s emerged that an upgrade is on its way pronto. Apple releases iOS 17.3. The next update is already almost here. As you may know, Apple is releasing an update to its iPhone software in time to meet a deadline from the European Union so it can comply with the Digital Markets Act. While that doesn’t affect anyone outside the EU, there are other elements in the next big update that are useful to all. When Apple releases iOS 17.4, in time for the deadline of March 6, it will have a slew of other features that are worth knowing about. Top of the list is an update to Stolen Device Protection, refining it so that the automatic security delay which currently kicks in when you’re away from a familiar location can be invoked in two different ways. One is the current “Away from Familiar Locations” setting, but you can also choose “Always” so a delay is always required to change security settings. But there are other changes coming your way in iOS 17.4 and it looks like being a huge update. There are new emoji, including a succulent slice of lime, a Smiley face shaking its head yes or no, a mushroom (oh, at last) a flaming phoenix and a chain that is broken in two. This last is useful for comments about the weakest link and so on, for instance. The phoenix would suit a newly resurgent career, while the lime would be good when you have to refer to, er, a lime. There are other new emoji but these are the most striking. There could be a new version of CarPlay coming in iOS 17.4, it seems, and not before time. Podcasts will transcribe spoken words into text, which will be very useful and the text can be copied. Siri will be able to respond to messages it’s reading out in multiple languages. So, when can we expect to see these glorious updates? Since Apple has said that it needs to meet the EU’s deadline of March 8, it’s going to be before then. The Monday of that week is March 4, the Tuesday, therefore is March 5. And that date is my prediction for the release of iOS 17.4. Mark your calendar now."

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: New Report Claims Bold Upgrade Coming",
    "content": "Cameras are a key component on every smartphone, and it looks like the next iPhones will see a photographic improvement, at least in the larger version of the Pro iPhone released this fall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Here’s what’s coming. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: will the iPhone 16 Pro have a bigger camera sensor? According to Weibo user Digital Chat Station, in a report picked up by  , this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count. The new report claims that this year’s Max will be an “image flagship”. I mean, it is already. This report contrasts with other rumors that the Pro and Pro Max would have photographic capabilities that were closer to each other than this year, where the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a 5x zoom in its telephoto, but the iPhone 15 Pro only has room for a 3x zoom. That rumor still stands, that both Pro and Pro Max will have 5x zoom on the telephoto lens. But the Max, it seems, will still outstrip the regular Pro photographically, this time on the main camera sensor. The pixel count, the report claims, will stay at 48 megapixels for both phones. But the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a stacked design, which promises better performance. There’ll be a better Analog to Digital Converter and better noise control. Most important of all, the sensor size will increase from the 1/1.28 inch sensor found on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro, to a 1/1.14 inch sensor. That 12% size increase could promise significantly improved low-light performance, as well as greater dynamic range and improved background blur for better bokeh effects. This could all be done without increasing the thickness of the phone. More details will leak, but this is a promising upgrade for all iPhone users who enjoy taking the best photographs with the least effort."

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the many discussions around Apple in the last seven days. You can also  . The camera continues to be a battleground for smartphone manufacturers. 2024 has a difference, though, with the widespread use of AI being promoted by several manufacturers. Apple’s plans on the AI front are tied up in iOS 18 (which will likely be revealed in June at WWDC 2024). Until then, we have details on the hardware Apple will use to upgrade the Pro handsets: \"...this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count.\" ( ). A new Apple iPhone 15 Pro with box and packaging (Photo illustration by John Keeble/Getty Images). Although the iPhone 15 Pro represents the best iPhone that Apple is offering, customer satisfaction has fallen well below the iPhone 15, reports the team at Perfect Rec. Part of that may well be down to the high expectations the Apple community had for the 15 Pro, expectations that Apple did not meet: \"We suspect the early adopter phenomenon might also be responsible for the large changes in satisfaction rates on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models between September and October. They may have had higher expectations for the phones and been somewhat disappointed by incremental upgrades than people who bought later in the cycle and may have been upgrading from older models.\" ( ). The iPhone modem continues to be an area where Apple can't design and build its way out of a reliance on Qualcomm. The purchase of Intel's modem division in 2019 was part of a plan to take production in-house, a plan that has so far failed to produce a usable modem. That has left Apple little choice but to continue its relationship with Qualcomm. This week, it confirmed that the deal will run for another two years, out to 2027. \"...Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see further delays. Apple was initially aiming to have an Apple-designed modem chip ready to go by 2024, but it missed that target. The company then wanted to introduce the modem chip in an   that would launch in spring 2025, but it will not be able to make that goal either.\" ( ). Apple is—incredibly reluctantly—opening up its iPhone App Store and payment services. While Apple is working hard to retain as much control over what can be installed on the phone someone has purchased, these changes are now available to the European public. Will that be the end of it? \"...the changes which allow for rival app marketplaces to exist, which change Apple’s commission fees to app developers, will probably spread beyond the EU to affect everyone. The same will apply to the alterations to which web browser is the default choice on the iPhone. While many will welcome greater variety in app providers, and which web browser they can easily use, Apple says the new system could be less secure.\" ( ). The quiet accessory beloved by many iPad users is set for an update. Apple’s stylus, the eponymous Pencil, is getting “Find Mu” capabilities to make a lost stylus easier to find. \"The big news is that the software hints compatibility with Apple Find My will be built in to the next Pencil. That’s a first for Apple Pencil. It’s not clear whether this means the next model will have Ultra Wideband built in or not. If it does, you’ll be able to precisely find the Pencil (though, trust me, it’s almost always going to have slipped down between the cushions on the couch, so look there first).\" ( ). Ahead of the public release, several reviewers have received Apple Vision Pro headsets and are quietly pushing the envelope now they are at home and not in a controlled Apple Demo space. While the technical prowess can be clearly seen, the human impact is finally on show: \"And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device.\" ( ). What does it take to make a box for an Apple product? Trung Phan goes on a deep dive to find out: \"As the first stage of the iPhone experience, Apple put in 1000s of hours perfecting the package. There is literally a \"packaging room\" where a design employee will spend months opening up 100s of prototypes — with different materials and shapes — to nail the experience (I need footage of the Apple designer making a $500k annual salary, who’s locked up in this room once-a-year opening boxes until the fingers bleed).\" ( ).

    "content": "Cody Rhodes will come face-to-face with Roman Reigns on SmackDown. Tonight’s broadcast of a sold-out SmackDown in Birmingham, AL featured Roman Reigns coming face-to-face with Cody Rhodes for the first time since Rhodes won his second Royal Rumble match. While Seth Rollins made a compelling case for Rhodes to challenge him at WrestleMania, Rhodes is fully expected to finish his story by challenging Reigns. Hours before SmackDown aired, there were also reports that   were backstage in Alabama. SmackDown also featured an appearance from Logan Paul, and women’s Royal Rumble winner Bayley declaring whom her WrestleMania 40 opponent will be and Last week’s broadcast of SmackDown garnered a viewership of 2.475 million. Logan Paul started off by saying they don’t want him here and he doesn’t want to be there either. Paul said Kevin Owens did more damage to Paul than Floyd Mayweather because Owens made him bleed. Getting the “what” treatment, Logan Paul mocked all the injured Superstars—CM Punk, Seth Rollins, etc.—while calling himself “unbreakable,” despite the fact that he did get  Logan Paul appeared on commentary, and Corey Graves seemed pretty awkward in the play-by-play role. Graves was hamstrung having to play the neutral party and not being able to cape for Logan Paul. He’s talented enough to eventually ease into this role, but it’s tough sledding early on. Austin Theory gets better every week. This week, Kevin Owens learned his lesson and used brass knuckles, but obscured them from the referee’s vision to ensure the victory. Prior to this Fatal 4-Way tag team match was a vignette showing Santos Escobar leading a toast to “eradicate” LWO. Joaquim Wilde asked the field “you wanna go viral?” before a handful of competitors launched him into the rest of the tag team. It was very impressive, but whether or not it will go viral remains to be seen. Wilde and Del Toro took everybody out, with help from Zelina Vega, who the turned her attention to Elektra Lopez with a Meteora. Pete Dunne and Tyler Bate won this match, meaning they advanced to the finals and will face the winners of the WWE Raw Fatal 4-Way tag team match. WWE rushed Bayley’s face-turn and feud with Iyo Sky as Damage CTRL were talking trash about Bayley backstage. Unfortunately for them, Bayley could overhear her. Wade Barrett lost a lot of credibility by saying he couldn’t wait to see whom Bayley was going to challenge, which came after Bayley overheard Iyo bashing Bayley backstage. Bayley began speaking Japanese to Damage CTRL, saying she could understand what they said behind her back. Bayley then challenged Iyo Sky in a great, if not rushed, moment. The Kabuki Warriors and Iyo then attacked Bayley as fans booed profusely. Bayley grabbed a pipe from under the ring and cleaned house. She then challenged Iyo Sky to a WrestleMania match as the crowd popped. Prior to this match was a brawl between Bobby Lashley and the Street Profits and the Final Testament. Team Lashley was saved by the returning B-Fab. This seems a way too early for Tiffany Stratton to compete on the main roster, but as a highly athletic gymnast, Stratton should eventually swim just fine after being thrown in the deep end. This was advertised as the SmackDown main event at 6:20, which means The Rock will probably cut his garden-variety half-hour promo. This wasn’t that bad of a debut for Stratton by any means. Roman Reigns eviscerated Seth Rollins. He started out by mentioning Rollins’ name, then saying “exactly, no pop!” He called Seth his “little brother.” He said Rollins can’t call himself the man running around in his wife’s clothes. He said Rollins broke his back three months into trying to carry WWE Raw. Then he began liming and asked Alabama if a workhorse “walks like this?” Reigns seemed legitimately annoyed by all the talk of him being a part-timer, saying he works 10-times less than Rollins but makes 10-times more money. This may have been the greatest promo of Reigns’ career. Crazy. Fans chanted “Cody!” as soon as Rhodes’ music cut off. Rhodes said he’s coming for Roman Reigns’ title, but not at WrestleMania. This prompted The Rock to return. The Rock faced off with Roman Reigns as SmackDown went off the air."

    "content": "BRAZIL - 2021/10/31: In this photo illustration the Google Maps logo seen displayed on a smartphone.  Google is working on a new AI-powered discovery tool that makes it easier to find places, the company announced today. The introduction of AI into Maps will make discovery easier by letting users search for places using natural language, Google says. The idea is that people will get clearer results from a search that better aligns with what they’re actually looking for. “Simply say what you’re looking for and our large-language models (LLMs) will analyze Maps’ detailed information about more than 250 million places and trusted insights from our community of over 300 million contributors to quickly make suggestions for where to go.” The announcement explains. Google gives the example of searching for “places with a vintage vibe in SF” or “activities for a rainy day.” The AI will understand what that means and deliver results based on reviews and descriptions from its database. Users can also ask a follow-up question such as “how about lunch” and Maps will reply with a contextual answer, so starting a new search isn’t necessary. The results are then sorted into different categories like shops, restaurants and markets, with review summaries that explain why they might be of interest. The new feature will only be available to people enrolled in Google's local guides program in the U.S. this week, which is a network of people who review, answer questions and check facts on Google Maps. This isn’t the first AI feature Google has introduced to Maps, it debuted a new “immersive view” tool last year that renders areas into highly detailed digital recreations. But discovery has long been one of the issues Google has needed to fix in Maps. The update could go some way to solving that problem. Users could can ask the Maps chatbot, for example, to give them non-touristy places while traveling, specifically avoiding spots that overcharge travelers. Or, in my case, a lunch spot near my office that is cheap and healthy. It’s surprisingly difficult to do either without reading hundreds of words on someone’s blog, which isn’t something you want to do on the go. Maps properly understanding your request—in full sentences—and delivering accurate results would be a big upgrade for the service."

Amid McMahon’s explosive lawsuit, Slim Jim released the following statement: “Slim Jim values integrity and respect in all of our partnerships,” said the brand in a public statement. “Given the recent disturbing allegations against Vince McMahon, at this time we’ve decided to pause our promotional activities with WWE.

Showing that animals, just like humans, have distinct personalities and are vulnerable, this photo brings awareness on the humans need to protect our oceans and marine life.” Fireworks under the Arctic, Finalist, Underwater category This photo was taken under the Arctic Ocean Polar Circle during an expedition of several underwater photographers. This creature was found at a depth of 15 meters attached to a seaweed due to its baby state. It’s about three centimeters and the species is virtually impossible to see anywhere else.  Burning Flower, Winner, Landscape category. “One of my favorite things when exploring Iceland is the incredible glacial river perspective seen from up high,” explained Marke Biegalski. “They're called 'braided river' systems, as they often resemble an intricate jumble of intertwining patterns. These networks of river channels flow from the glaciers toward the sea, carrying vital nutrients in the form of sediment. When the flow of the rivers decreases, the sediment gets deposited on the river bed, leaving behind small temporary islands of dark volcanic sand.” Snowy desert in the wind, Finalist, Landscape category The photo was taken in Yuli County, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.

They were illuminated by a scurion lamp to create a contrast with the dark sky. In the background, the Milky Way curves over the hills, revealing the colors and shapes of stars and nebulae. This pano was taken with a specialized camera for astrophotography, which allows capturing more details of the universe.” Fukinagashi, Finalist, Plant Life category In Spain’s Sierra de Baza, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, the genuine pinus sylvestris nevadensis stoically survive. No Way Out, Finalist, Environmental Impact category The encroachment of human settlements into bushland in South Africa means that this young female leopard has no way to find her own new territory, cut off by miles long fence separating the wild from human population. Racing to Extinction, Finalist, Sharing the Planet category A mangrove forest surrounds the Graha Indah residential area in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, Borneo. Indonesia’s abundant natural resources have attracted large-scale foreign investment for decades — drawn by loosely regulated mining, logging, and palm oil production that causes irreparable harm to its biodiversity. Widespread deforestation is now the primary threat to the critically endangered orangutan that can be found only on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.

The bitcoin price has rocketed back over the last year, boosting the wider crypto market, even as  \"Biden has declared a Federal 'emergency' because bitcoin is winning,\" Pierre Rochard, head of research at Colorado-based bitcoin miner Riot Platforms,   to X,  : \"the $3 trillion deficit, $34 trillion debt, and insolvent fiat banking system\" could be considered an \"emergency.\" The huge increase in the supply of U.S. dollars and U.S. debt through the Covid pandemic and lockdowns has galvanized bitcoin supporters who fear the collapse of the U.S. dollar is imminent. \"Over the last ten years, all fiat has declined against the dollar, even as the dollar has collapsed against bitcoin,\" tech investor and former Coinbase  chief technology investor Balaji Srinivasan   to X. \"Biden vs Trump is the American election. Bitcoin vs dollar is the internet election. Which is truly more important? The election doesn’t matter as much if they lose the printer. Just one or two more orders of magnitude, and that will be clear.\""

    "title": "Russia Has Massed 500 Tanks For An Attack On Kupyansk",
    "content": "The Ukrainian 4th Tank Brigade in 2023. Five hundred tanks. More than 600 fighting vehicles. Hundreds of howitzers. Forty thousand troops. According to Ukraine’s eastern command, Russia has assembled a huge field army in eastern Ukraine opposite the free Ukrainian city of Kupyansk. It’s obvious what this army aims to do: retake a huge swathe of Kharkiv Oblast that the Russians briefly occupied in 2022—until a powerful Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the oblast late that year. Everything east of the nearest major river is the goal. “The Russian Federation plans to seize the entire Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and part of Kharkiv Oblast up to the Oskil River by March 2024,” the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies  . The river threads through Kupyansk from the north. Why March? Because that’s when Russia will “vote” for “president” in a national “election.” In fact, Vladimir Putin is the only real candidate—and will maintain his brutal, dictatorial control over Russia  the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. A slice of Kharkiv would be an election-day gift to Putin from the Russian army in Ukraine. Some or part of around 10 Ukrainian brigades, anchored in the north by the 3rd Tank Brigade and south by the 4th Tank Brigade, defends Kupyansk and surrounding settlements. It’s a significant forces with perhaps 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks, fighting vehicles and howitzers. But people and vehicles aren’t the problem for the Ukrainians. The problem is  . The United States was one of the biggest donors of 155-millimeter shells for Ukraine’s best big guns—and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress cut off aid to Ukraine last fall. Since then, Ukrainian forces’ daily allotment of shells has fallen by two-thirds to just 2,000 rounds. Russian forces meanwhile fire as many as 10,000 shells a day, thanks to a steady supply of ammo from North Korea. Russia’s new firepower advantage allows it to concentrate artillery without much fear of Ukrainian counterbattery fire— . “This situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach: the systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible,” Ukrainian analysis team Frontelligence Insight  . The demolition already has begun. “Our satellite imagery reveals sustained and intense artillery damage” around Kupyansk, Frontelligence Insight reported. “Artillery shortages and delays in Western security assistance will create uncertainty in Ukrainian operational plans,” the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C.  , “and likely prompt Ukrainian forces to husband materiel, which may force Ukrainian forces to make tough decisions about prioritizing certain sectors of the front over sectors where limited territorial setbacks are least damaging.” It’s not clear whether Kyiv is willing to trade away any of Kharkiv Oblast. With a pre-war population of 1.4 million, Kharkiv is Ukraine’s third city—and hosts strategic war industries including Ukraine’s main tank plant. So the Kupyansk garrison must hold. Anticipating the coming offensive, the Ukrainian defense ministry has organized new mechanized brigades and deployed them to Kupyansk to reinforce the garrison.  Perhaps most importantly, Ukrainian workshops are building explosives-laden first-person-view drones—tens of thousands of them per month. As artillery ammunition becomes scarce, Ukrainian brigades are flinging more and more FPVs at the Russians: sometimes thousands per day all along the 600-mile front. But the FPVs range just two miles or so—too short to target artillery that might be 15 or miles from the line of contact. Drone-operators have made quick work of small Russian assault groups that, for months now, have been probing the Kupyansk sector. But can a swarm of two-pound drones, even thousands of them, defeat 500 tanks and 650 fighting vehicles as they attack behind a wall of artillery fire? We may find out."

    "title": "As Ukraine Runs Out Of Ammo, Russian Artillery Gunners Get Cocky",
    "content": "A Ukrainian 2S3 howitzer. When U.S. aid to Ukraine ran out in late December and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress refused to vote on Pres. Joe Biden’s proposal to spend another $61 billion on the war effort, Ukraine’s artillery batteries were the first to feel this betrayal. That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

Singapore billionaire banker and property developer   died on Saturday morning at the age of 95, according to a statement from  , in which he and his family have a significant stake. The statement did not give the cause of death. The chairman emeritus of UOB spearheaded expansion of the bank that his father Wee Kheng Chiang founded in 1935. Under Wee Cho Yaw’s leadership of more than five decades, the bank grew from one branch to a regional bank present in 19 countries and territories. As of September 2023, UOB had S$516 billion ($384 billion) of assets. Known in the banking industry as an astute dealmaker, Wee led the bank’s multiple acquisitions over the years. The biggest was the S$10 billion purchase of Singapore’s Overseas Union Bank in 2001, beating out bigger rival DBS Group. “Without doubt, Wee Cho Yaw is one of Singapore’s most successful entrepreneurs,” Wong Kan Seng, chairman of UOB, said in a statement. “Through hard work, determination, decisiveness and strong Asian values, he built UOB into one of the world’s most admired banks.” In 2007, Wee handed the reins of UOB to his eldest son Ee Cheong, who is now deputy chairman and CEO of the bank. He stepped down as chairman six years later and retired from the board in 2018. “My father has left an indelible mark in Singapore and the region,” Ee Cheong said in a statement. “He has been a source of inspiration for me in all aspects of my life. Much will be said about his business acumen and dealmaking but it will be the values of honor, enterprise, unity and commitment that will be the legacy he leaves us at UOB.” Ee Cheong accelerated the regional expansion of UOB with the acquisition in 2022 of Citibank’s consumer banking businesses across Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam for about $3.6 billion. His son Teng Wen is the cofounder of the Lo & Behold Group, a restaurant and hotel chain in Singapore With a net worth of $7.1 billion, Wee has been on the   Billionaires list since 2000.

Jean Carroll in more than three dozen separate posts, hours after the defamation trial against Trump was canceled for the day because of a juror illness. The former president could end up paying more than $10 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll  The former president posted more than 40 times in the span of less than an hour Monday morning, attacking Carroll using snippets of interviews Carroll has done with the media, purported Facebook posts from Carroll and original posts from Trump attacking Carroll’s claims about him. Trump   Carroll of changing her story about what happened when Trump allegedly raped Carroll in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman in the mid 1990s, saying Monday that Carroll “doesn’t know the day, month, season, year, or decade - because it did not happen.” The former president—who has already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault in a separate lawsuit also brought by Carroll—  to the second trial as a “witch hunt.” Trump is expected to take the stand to testify in the trial this week, though court was canceled Monday after a juror went home sick. Trump will not be penalized for his attacks on Carroll outside of court because there are no restrictions on his speech outside of court. If the former president takes the stand in the trial he won’t be able to testify that he didn’t know Carroll, didn’t sexually assault her and didn’t defame her because he’s already been found liable for those allegations. If Trump does take the stand and makes any of those statements about Carroll while he is testifying, he could be held in contempt of court. More than $10 million. That’s how much Carroll is seeking from Trump in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount of punitive damages. The trial will only determine how much Trump has to pay Carroll in damages after he was already found liable of defamation and sexual assault in a separate trial. The defamation trial against Trump revolves around comments the former president made in 2019 after Carroll alleged the former president raped her in a Bergforg Goodman’s dressing room in the 1990s. Trump responded to that allegation by saying he’s “never met this person in my life,” the incident “never happened,” and Carroll is “not my type.” Carroll   Trump for defamation in 2019, alleging Trump’s reaction to her allegations caused her “emotional pain and suffering at the hands of the man who raped her, as well as injury to her reputation, honor and dignity.” That case didn’t make it to trial until recently, however, due to a years-long legal dispute as Trump argued he can’t be sued because he made the comments while acting in his official capacity as president.

In May, a jury   with Carroll and found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, though the jury rejected her claim that Trump raped her.

    "title": "Serious Warning Issued for 2 Billion Google Chrome Users",
    "content": "If you’re one of the billion-plus users of Google Chrome on Windows, then you should note the serious new warning issued this week. The surprise is that this warning—on Chrome’s behalf—comes from one of its harshest, most vocal critics. Serious new Google Chome warning for all Microsoft Windows users Google Chrome   the worldwide browser market, with approaching 65% of the market to Apple Safari’s less than 20% in second place. Every other alternative, including Microsoft Edge, is just an also-ran. Microsoft isn’t used to any kind of also-ran status, and in a world where its Windows operating system has an even more   desktop market share, a new report suggests it is doing something about this. If you use Chrome on a Windows device, the report warns that your user experience will be badly hit. The research was sponsored by Mozilla, developer of the Firefox browser which lags a little behind Edge, with a 3.3% versus 5.3% market share. Mozilla   “two independent experts… to investigate Microsoft’s design practices across its core OS (Windows 10 and 11), web browser (Edge), and search engine (Bing).” “We find,”  , “Microsoft repeatedly using harmful design to influence users into using Edge.” Claims include “harmful preselection, visual interference, trick wording, and disguised ads patterns to skew user choice of which browser to install… Obstruction to dissuade the switch [to a different default browser] and a refusal to switch the corresponding default app for various local web-related filetypes… [and ongoing] “harmful patterns to push the user back towards Edge.” Mozilla is no fan of Chrome, to say the least. “Chrome is the only major browser that does not offer meaningful protection against cross-site tracking,” it has said of the long-delayed removal of tracking cookies from Chrome. And its website warns that Chrome’s “privacy record is questionable… Google actually collects a disturbingly large amount of data from its users—Google runs the world’s largest advertising network, thanks in large part to data they harvest from their users.” But the report that Mozilla has just published is not really about Edge competing for users with Firefox. It is all about Chrome. Because, in reality, most Windows users by the numbers will install Chrome. And so it serves as a warning to those users. With a fresh Windows desktop, users find Edge pre-installed and set as the default. It is also pinned to the taskbar and can’t be uninstalled. If the user decides to install Chrome, the report shows how Microsoft interrupts the install, claiming security and privacy benefits of Edge. The researchers warn that “users may be alarmed when they see the Edge promotional message appear within the Chrome download page, reasoning that since the banner is unusual it must be very important.” Edge promotion features prominently Such interruptions occur whichever browser is being installed. But “if the user is looking to download Google Chrome,” the report says, “Microsoft takes an even more aggressive approach, intervening twice more in the user journey.” Edge popup during Chrome install Edge promotion after searching to download Chrome Edge ad injected into Chrome install page itself There are other obstructive examples cited in the report, including a survey mid Chrome install, which points again to the benefits of Edge. “We deem this survey and its subsequent page an example of Obstruction,” the report says, “that makes it harder for users to complete Chrome installation.” In parallel, as seen below, the import of Google data into Edge seems to be presented as a standard setup dialog. User preferences are not highlighted. It’s very easy for a user to click the Apply button with the default settings as shown. Users asked to import Google data into Edge This behavior, the researchers say, begins as soon as a user starts to search for browsers. The report includes multiple examples of ads injected into the search and install process, all of which seem to disrupt the user’s choice based on “inside” knowledge of what they intend to install. The report isn't limited to browsers, it also looks at search and cites examples where users are encouraged to shift from Google’s search to Microsoft Bing’s within an alternative browser, such as Chrome—assuming that install was not deterred. Bing Vs Chrome search setting prompt The report acknowledges that “Edge is a relatively minor player. Since Windows is still the dominant OS, it is clear that millions of Windows users have overcome the practices we’ve questioned to successfully download and use Chrome. Microsoft may therefore argue these practices don’t unfairly skew the browser market or user choice.” Google Chrome versus Microsoft Edge doesn't really represent a genuine David Vs Goliath in any shape or form. But the world has changed, and the other small browsers squaring up to the bigger players, including Firefox, does. The researchers are based in the UK and tested their various user journeys on Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Pro. There was no VPN in use, and so their location would have been readily available. As such, it’s not possible to determine from the report how widespread this is across other territories. But such claims about Microsoft's push to Edge are not limited to Mozilla’s report, and we have seen other recent complaints about Microsoft’s push to Edge. Despite this new research, these types of claim are not new, and we have seen similar   before, with Microsoft pushing users towards its ecosystem and Google doing the same,  . The backdrop to this current story, though, is Europe’s DMA, and the regulations that look to disrupt so-called gatekeepers and gateway platforms from doing exactly this kind of thing. The idea is that default apps can be changed, small players can compete, and house apps can be uninstalled if required. In its blogpost about the report, Mozilla says that “with the implementation of DMA in the European Union marking the start of a wave of global competition regulation, we hoped that the barriers to browser competition would be dismantled. However, even where there is movement in the right direction, improvements have been incomplete and are grudgingly offered only in markets where regulators have forced platform owners to make changes to respect browser choice.” Mozilla goes on to complain that “Microsoft recently pledged to stop some of the actions it takes to force Edge on users who have selected other browsers… [but] they will only be deployed to users in the EEA.” Windows users everywhere… continue to have their choices inhibited, overridden and undermined by Microsoft’s use of harmful design. Regulatory action around the world is needed to restore browser choice and competition across all of the major platforms.” I have reached out to Microsoft for a response to the Mozilla report."

    "title": "iOS 17.4 Release Date: Apple’s Best New iPhone Feature To Be Upgraded In Weeks",
    "content": "If you’ve updated to the latest iPhone software, iOS 17.3, you’ll know that the key new feature was Stolen Device Protection, so if someone steals your iPhone, heaven forbid, and knows your passcode, their ability to get into your digital life or remove you from your phone, is significantly curtailed. Now it’s emerged that an upgrade is on its way pronto. Apple releases iOS 17.3. The next update is already almost here. As you may know, Apple is releasing an update to its iPhone software in time to meet a deadline from the European Union so it can comply with the Digital Markets Act. While that doesn’t affect anyone outside the EU, there are other elements in the next big update that are useful to all. When Apple releases iOS 17.4, in time for the deadline of March 6, it will have a slew of other features that are worth knowing about. Top of the list is an update to Stolen Device Protection, refining it so that the automatic security delay which currently kicks in when you’re away from a familiar location can be invoked in two different ways. One is the current “Away from Familiar Locations” setting, but you can also choose “Always” so a delay is always required to change security settings. But there are other changes coming your way in iOS 17.4 and it looks like being a huge update. There are new emoji, including a succulent slice of lime, a Smiley face shaking its head yes or no, a mushroom (oh, at last) a flaming phoenix and a chain that is broken in two. This last is useful for comments about the weakest link and so on, for instance. The phoenix would suit a newly resurgent career, while the lime would be good when you have to refer to, er, a lime. There are other new emoji but these are the most striking. There could be a new version of CarPlay coming in iOS 17.4, it seems, and not before time. Podcasts will transcribe spoken words into text, which will be very useful and the text can be copied. Siri will be able to respond to messages it’s reading out in multiple languages. So, when can we expect to see these glorious updates? Since Apple has said that it needs to meet the EU’s deadline of March 8, it’s going to be before then. The Monday of that week is March 4, the Tuesday, therefore is March 5. And that date is my prediction for the release of iOS 17.4. Mark your calendar now."

    "content": "A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee   Friday to figure out ways to make pulse oximeters more accurate when doing readings on darker skin both in hospitals and at home, after research showed wrong readings led to treatment delays in minorities. Close-up of a Black person using a pulse oximeter to check their blood oxygen saturation level and  Pulse oximeters are devices usually placed on the tip of the finger and used to measure oxygen levels in the blood, and are typically used on people experiencing shortness of breath, or people with lung or heart conditions,   to the American Lung Association. Because the use of pulse oximeters by patients at home and in hospitals by healthcare providers increased due to the Covid pandemic, the FDA released a   in 2021 warning people that although the devices are useful, they have their limitations. Some factors that may affect the accuracy of the devices’ readings are skin color, nail polish, ambient lighting, dyes or tattoos and severe anemia, James Lee, division director of the FDA’s Division of Sleep Disordered Breathing, Respiratory and Anesthesia Devices   during the meeting. Over 20 state attorneys general sent a   in November 2023 urging the FDA to update its guidelines to include warnings that address pulse oximetry’s inaccuracy on darker skin to “prevent additional severe illness and mortalities among darker skinned people.” Research has shown darker skin tones receive more inaccurate readings than lighter ones: 11.7% of apparently normal readings in Black patients were wrong, compared to 3.6% of readings in white patients, a 2020 New England Journal of Medicine  found. “We must keep in the forefront of our minds that this is a significant health equity issue,” Scott Lucas, vice president of device safety at nonprofit healthcare organization ECRI, said during the meeting. “The color of a patient’s skin should never degrade the quality or the effectiveness of tools that healthcare providers use to give lifesaving care.” Pulse oximeters are typically clipped onto a patient’s finger, and work by emitting light that passes through the skin, tissue and blood to the other side of the sensor,   to Yale Medicine. The sensor detects how much light passes through without being absorbed, and that measurement determines the blood oxygen levels. The devices are more inaccurate on darker skin tones because higher levels of melanin absorb higher levels of light, which limit the light’s ability to penetrate through the skin, a 2022 Sensors   found. Black patients have higher odds of having low blood oxygen noted in their blood-drawn readings than white patients, according to a separate 2022   published in BMJ. The use of pulse oximeters increased during the Covid pandemic because they’re used to   how severe the disease is. Compared to white patients, pulse oximeters overestimated blood oxygen levels by an average of 1.7% in Asian patients, 1.2% in Black patients and 1.1% in Hispanic patients, a 2022 JAMA Internal Medicine   found. These incorrect readings led to a delay in minorities receiving certain treatments for Covid, which researchers believe contributed to worse health outcomes in minorities during the pandemic. During the pandemic, inaccurate readings resulted in higher hospitalization in Black patients than white patients by 2.4%, and higher rates of readmission by 8.3%, a 2023 American Journal of Epidemiology   found.

    "content": "Tennis legend Maria Sharapova poses for the media as she is unveiled as car manufacturer Porsche's  Tennis legend Maria Sharapova says that it doesn’t matter what sport she's playing. There is something about her that’s a constant: “Once a competitor, always a competitor.” The longtime world No. 1 and winner of all four singles Grand Slam events has taken up a new pastime, pickleball. Now that pickleball has captivated sports lovers all over the world, it has created interest not just in the growing Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) but has also drawn in many of the world's most beloved tennis stars. Sharapova is part of the highly-touted Pickleball Slam tournament, where she will join fellow tennis legends John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, and Steffi Graf this Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, for the event called Pickleball Slam 2. Sharapova, who has thus far been waiting her turn to compete on the biggest of stages, hints that pickleball is not “just for fun” but brings out the top athlete in everyone, especially Hall of Fame-level tennis stars. “I think all the legends on the court come from very competitive backgrounds, and there will be no holding back, which will make it so much more exciting and fun,” Sharapova said during our interview Friday. “Every time I play, it's been really fun to see how much I giggle, but also how frustrated I can get during some of the games.” Sharapova adds that while playing and even practicing pickleball, her game will often“span a variety of emotions.” This weekend, tennis diehards will get to see the duo of Sharapova and McEnroe take on husband and wife team Agassi and Graf, who will compete for a $1 million purse. Pickleball Slam 2, created and produced by Horizon Sports & Experiences (HS&E) and InsideOut Sports & Entertainment (ISE), will be broadcast live during primetime on ESPN at 8:30 PM from Hard Rock Live at Seminole at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida. During the inaugural Pickleball Slam event in April 2023, fans saw Agassi team up with Andy Roddick to beat McEnroe and Michael Chang and win the first $1 million purse, which was the largest tournament purse in pickleball history. Still, to Sharapova, who logged a 645–171 singles record over her 19-year career, playing pickleball is still relatively “new territory,” she said. “The main reason I wanted to participate in this event was to play against Steffi Graf, who I admired for so many years,” Sharapova explains. Graf, who retired from pro tennis in 1999, was the last tennis player to win the “Calendar Slam” in 1988 when she won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open within the same year. It wasn’t until 2004, the same year Graf was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, that Sharapova burst onto the scene at age 17 by winning Wimbledon, beating Serena Williams in two straight sets. “It’ll be great to compete against (Graf) and Andre with John—all of us playing this sport that’s having such a moment,” Sharapova said. “I’ve been practicing a bunch, so we’ll see. But I think John and I are going to be a formidable team.” Andre Agassi and Sharapova pose prior to a show match during the WTA Tennis tournament at the  David Levy, HS&E’s co-CEO/founder, said that he thinks this weekend’s Pickleball Slam 2 “is the ultimate showcase for the fastest-growing sport in the world.” “As we bring together four former world No. 1 tennis players to play for a $1M purse in primetime on ESPN, widespread fan interest in this year’s event is driving significant brand engagement.” Levy adds that big-time sponsors have been beating down the door, and in addition to Hard Rock, Slam 2’s host, State Farm, Brighthouse Financial, Franklin Sports, E*Trade, and AstraZeneca/Calquence have all jumped in to participate in sponsoring pickleball, one of the world’s fastest-growing sports. As an added authentic element this year, Levy said that “Florida residents can place bets on the Slam 2 via Hard Rock Bet.” But what about Sharapova’s legendary swing? I asked her whether her world-class tennis skills and big court movement work to her advantage in a small racket/paddle sport such as pickleball. “I was initially quite surprised by how different everything felt about pickleball. I thought there would be more similarities,” Sharapova said. “But I guess there's no such thing as ‘enough’ power.” Yet, along with her competitive mindset, Sharapova said that she thinks, come Sunday, she will “definitely use a lot of that strength that I had in my tennis career. But there’s a new skill set around hitting the short balls in the kitchen,”—or the non-volley zone, right in front of the net. “All these new terms that I'm becoming familiar with have been a very entertaining journey,” she added. “But overall, yeah, I think there are a few elements of tennis that you can bring in, but I'd say I was surprised at how different it felt.” Besides being a fresh new challenge for elite athletes and weekend warriors alike, Sharapova also thinks that pickleball has a bright future as a sport. “On the business side, it’s definitely growing, and how could it not? The engagement across the country is extremely high. You can see why people are really having fun with it.” Sharapova notes the growth of the game within tennis and recreation clubs all over America, “engaging with it and building pickle courts on their properties.” She admits that there are natural challenges to advancing any sport, but “by having more of it on TV and accessible to people,” she said, “it grows the game.” Of course, I had to ask the tennis phenom about her first love, tennis and the current crop of WTA stars making their mark. The two players that have stood out the most to Sharapova are world No. 3 Coco Gauff, who won last year’s US Open, and up-and-comer Mirra Andrea, the current WTA no. 35 player. “I've loved watching a new generation rise up to the occasion,” Sharapova. “I was so impressed with how Coco handled the victory in New York last year. Also, it’s great seeing the rise of new names and opportunities for athletes like Mirra Andreeva. Sharapova adds, “We’re seeing so much more consistency in the women's game and that has been really refreshing.” *****"

    "title": "Shell Bay: Golf’s Newest $1 Million Club Towers Above Miami Market",
    "content": "An aerial rendering of the new Shell Bay development in the Miami area, a private enclave that has a  “There are way more people who want an amazing golf experience in the Miami region than there are available amazing golf experiences,” explains Alex Witkoff, the co-CEO of the Witkoff Group and a developer of one of the most unique new private clubs in the world. In Hallandale Beach, Florida, just north of Miami, the Shell Bay Club is tucked on a prime piece of land between the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. And golf is the focal point of the 150-acre luxury development, with a new championship course that demonstrates the delicate balance between supply and demand in a major market. Shell Bay is the first private club in the Miami area in more than two decades and the price of membership for what its founders are calling a “generational opportunity” is well over $1 million. And there’s a waiting list to get in. “People want the best of the best and, given that there hadn't been an experience like this delivered in a few decades and it won't be replicated, the response has been extraordinary,” said Ari Pearl, the founder and president of PPG Development, another founding partner in the Shell Bay project. “It’s been global in nature,” added Pearl, who has been a prominent figure in the South Florida real estate and development industry for more than two decades. “We have people from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles. Also internationally, Europe and Asia, in addition to locally in Miami.” Greg Norman's design team has created a completely new course at the Shell Club just north of Miami.  The game of golf is unquestionably booming in popularity in recent years, but Shell Bay epitomizes the challenge of preserving golf on exceptionally valuable real estate in the heart of a crowded metropolitan market. Consider that Melreese Country Club, about 20 miles away and the only municipal golf course in Miami (one of the most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the country), closed for good last year in favor of a redevelopment project that will include a Major League Soccer stadium, hotels, an office park, and a retail area with shops and restaurants. It’s a massive project, one that will create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in rent payments to the city over the life of a 99-year lease. Melreese had a storied history and was a successful and beloved public golf course, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual net revenues for the city. But what is the realistic lifespan for a facility in such a prime location, on land next to Miami International Airport? In that case, and with the push and pull between supply and demand, it was demand for land that won out over the demand for golf – due to dollars signs. So, to make golf at Shell Bay Club viable in such a prime location, it’s become an outlier in several respects. The first is the cost to get in. Golf is the centerpiece to the new Shell Bay Club, a luxury development just north of Miami. It's  At well over $1 million, Shell Bay has one of the most expensive membership buy-ins of any golf club in the nation, the byproduct of what Witkoff says is a “vicious dearth” of golf in the market. “Land is very hard to accumulate in South Florida,” he said. “I don't see this ever being able to be replicated in the Miami region because I don't see where else you would get this amount of land close to the ocean. So, for us there was a kind of once in a generation opportunity to deliver a state-of-the-art golf facility and then with so much more — residences, tennis and so on and so forth.” Among the luxury amenities at Shell Bay, which is also partnering with Auberge Resorts to provide a 60-room boutique hotel and spa on property, is a tennis facility run by the renowned Bryan brothers that has courts with all four grand slam surfaces, not to mention pickleball and Padel courts. There’s a basketball court, batting cages, bowling alleys, a billiard room, and a 48-slip yacht club. Rendering of the private, multimillion dollar residences that overlook the new golf course at Shell  But the centerpiece is the golf course. There was once another course on the property, part of the old Diplomat Golf Resort. That’s long gone, as all the original holes were blown up and sand-capped, with Greg Norman’s team adding elevation changes and creating a completely new design – one that includes an 18-hole championship course and a 9-hole Par 3 layout, along with a 12-acre, state-of-the-art practice facility. Every lake on property was moved, so Shell Bay’s golf course really was reconstructed from the subgrade up, and with 4,000 new trees added (along with 1,000 different plant species) every playing corridor has completely changed from what was there before. More than 4,000 new trees were planted at the Shell Bay Club as part of the complete reconstruction  With a variety of risk-reward shot-making options and waterfront challenges, the new course can stretch to over 7,200 yards, making it one of the longest in golf-rich South Florida. The property was designed with visions of hosting a professional tournament in mind — with contoured greens and sweeping Australian sandbelt-style bunkers — and the Norman ties certainly make a future LIV Golf event in Miami market a distinct possibility, especially when you consider that LIV golfers like Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed, Henrik Stenson and Lee Westwood are members. Another unique element of the Shell Bay project that’s made keeping golf a component of the development a reality is the residential tower with 108 bespoke condominiums and penthouses. While more commonplace in some densely populated Asian countries, U.S. golf courses with a neighboring tower – whether residential, hotel or otherwise – is rare. “Building a tower was a no brainer,” said Witkoff. “It's very rare to have 150 acres in such a prime urban area within a major MSA. We’re able to build a tower and it makes sense to do it, more so than on a random Caribbean island or Montana or Wyoming. The opportunity to get this is unique.” In keeping golf as a core part of the Shell Bay project, a parcel of prime real estate was set aside  Residences are selling for between $2 million and $11 million, and while there’s a social membership to the club that comes with owning a home in the luxurious gated community, access to the golf course is separate. The course also won’t be an amenity for future guests of the boutique hotel when it’s completed. A golf club with a membership costing more than $1 million is not common, by any means. But either is a new high-end course (and community) that’s water accessible in a bustling metro area like Miami. And it appears the demand is there at Shell Bay. For land and for golf. “Golf is the background and canvas for the development,” said PPG’s Pearl. “The golf course is the backdrop but you’re also getting views of the ocean and the Intercoastal, with residences overlooking the marina and the tennis center. When you come through those gates, you’re in a real urban oasis.” With a new Greg Norman-designed championship course that aspires to host professional golf"

Now, as Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signals U.S. interest rates should begin to fall later this year, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci has predicted the bitcoin price will surge to at least $170,000 per bitcoin after its April supply cut—which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $3.3 trillion. — Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has held U.S. interest rates steady but primed the market for a  \"Go back and look at bitcoin halving cycles,\" Scaramucci, the founder of Skybridge Capital who briefly served as former U.S. president Donald Trump's communications director, said during a   with trader Scott Melker. \"The day that bitcoin halves, multiply it by four [and] 18 months later and it’s been uncanny that that’s been the price of bitcoin.

    "title": "Russia Deployed Jammers To Beat Ukraine’s Drones, But They Don’t Work",
    "content": "A Russian MT-LB, fitted with an RP-377 jammer, burns. A Russian mechanized assault in the vicinity of Novomykhailivka, 10 miles west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, should sound alarms in the Kremlin. The Tuesday assault was small—just three T-72 tanks, seven MT-LB armored tractors and a single BMP-2 fighting vehicle, possibly from the Russian army’s 20th Motor Rifle Division. And its total destruction by Ukrainian drones in the span of three hours isn’t terribly unusual.  Russian attacks end in drone-inflicted defeat. No, what should worry Russian commanders is that the Ukrainian drones, apparently from the 79th Air Assault Brigade or the 7th Ranger Battalion, were unbothered by the electronic-warfare gear the Russians usually attach to their vehicles right before an attack. The E.W. systems broadcast radio noise that, in theory, should scramble the signals by which drone-operators control their two-pound, two-mile-range first-person-view drones, each laden with a pound of explosives. But during the Tuesday assault, any defensive jamming failed—and the drones swiftly demolished the Russian column. Russian forces “do not have any massive protection against enemy drones,” one Russian blogger complained in a missive   @wartranslated. “Everything they install has long been outdated and does not cover the enemy’s new frequencies.” For friends of a free Ukraine, this is good news. With pro-Russian Republicans in the U.S. Congress blockading U.S. aid to Ukraine, Kyiv’s artillery batteries are starved for ammunition: they’re firing just 2,000 rounds a day, a fifth what Russian batteries can fire. So Ukrainian troops are replacing artillery with FPV drones, which don’t require precision manufacturing and might cost just a few hundred dollars apiece. Ukraine is building, and flinging at Russian forces,  . Jamming has been Russia’s best defense against the swarm of Ukrainian drones, just as it’s been   best defense against a equally dense swarm of  drones. The difference is that Ukrainian jamming apparently still works. Russian jamming, on the other hand, may be failing. “The problem requires emergency measures,” the blogger intoned. As FPV drones replaced artillery as the most serious threat to Russian ground forces late last year, the Russian military responded by bolting, to its armored vehicles, whatever radio-jammers were available:   and   that magnetically stick to the outside of a tank. There was some risk the jammers would thwart Ukrainian drone operations. “I saw the spectrograms,” Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Beskrestnov wrote after inspecting a captured RP-377. “The interference is very high quality.” If that happened, it didn’t happen for long. Today Ukrainian drones are flying everywhere, all the time, along the 600-mile front of Russia’s wider war on Ukraine. While it helps that Ukrainian drone-operators   Russia’s most powerful fixed jammers, it may be even  helpful to Ukraine’s war effort that the shorter-range mobile jammers—Russian troops’ last-ditch defenses—seemingly aren’t jamming much of anything anymore. Maybe the blogger is right, and Ukrainian operators are hopping frequencies in order to dodge Russian jamming. Or maybe there’s some other trick, such as a built-in artificial intelligence that briefly takes over control of a drone when its human controller gets jammed. In any event, the Ukrainians seem to have found a viable approach to defensive firepower that buys them some time as their allies scramble to provide more artillery ammo—and as U.S. president Joe Biden   that allow him to overcome pro-Russia Republicans’ opposition to Ukraine’s self-defense. “It looks like this is the strategy of the Ukrainian armed forces,” a second Russian blogger  . “Going on the defensive, using drones, fairy tales about a shortage of shells.” Ukraine’s shell-shortage is real, in fact. But so is its drone-first approach to ground warfare. As Ukraine ramped up robotic strikes, Russia gambled on jammers to protect its troops. It seems to have been a losing bet."

The underwhelming response from developers comes amid signs the government’s housing curbs—which include raising the additional buyer’s stamp duty rates for foreign buyers—along with softening economic conditions are beginning to weigh on the once resilient Singapore property market. Developers sold just 6,671 residential units in 2023, the lowest in the last 15 years, government data released last month showed. Sales at recent property launches this year have been subdued."

    "title": "iMessage And WhatsApp Soundly Beaten By Radical Google Messages Update",
    "content": "The Google Vs Apple Vs Facebook battle on your smartphone is about to take an exciting new twist; if you’re an Android user, Google has just revealed a huge AI upgrade that could change the way you use your device. Google’s latest release will be a game-changer The tech giants behind the most popular smartphone OS and app ecosystems have spent years battling for your messaging loyalties. And for good reason. There are no other apps as sticky as WhatsApp or iMessage or Google Messages. They are the center of your social network, to which you return through your day, every day. And so, just as Samsung   for its own smartphone AI offerings, here comes Google with something more game-changing. How about incorporating Bard directly into its core messaging platform. A readymade UI and user base. No new apps to install or complex productivity app extensions to master. This is ChatGPT-like simplicity, pre-installed on every Android smartphone. Google has spent two-years pushing its Messages app as the default Android alternative to iMessage. This has included end-to-end encryption and RCS by default, and multiple feature releases. Now, with that done, here comes an AI upgrade that connects Messages users with Google, not just with one another. According to Bard itself, this “promises to be a game-changer for how we communicate. It's an AI assistant that can improve your messaging experience in various ways, from facilitating communication to enhancing creativity and providing information… It will be your personal AI assistant within your messaging app.” There were hints last year that Google might be looking at bringing Bard into Messages, albeit nothing substantive. But having unpicked the latest pre-release APK,   now   that Bard is indeed “coming to Google Messages to ‘help you write messages, translate languages, identify images, and explore interests’.” There are a raft of obvious tasks this could simplify—creating a recipe or drafting a text for your boss are two of the examples given. But that just scratches the surface of the real opportunity, which (for Google) is much bigger. When ChatGPT was released, you’ll remember the   that came thick and fast. The future of web search was not going to be browser-based. It would be interactive and chatty. Google’s patchy rush to release Bard followed. To begin, you’ll likely experiment with AI text composition, image recognition, simple information requests—but make no mistake, AI chatbot driven search is the prize ( , ). The AI models need more advanced structuring to turn chat into workable commerce requests, but the end will justify the means/investment. According to Bard, “it can be your handy shopping sidekick in several ways… It can suggest thoughtful and unique gift ideas… It can compare different models, highlight key features and specs, and find reviews and ratings from real users… It can scour online stores and social media to show you what's hot and where to find it… It can track prices across different retailers to ensure you're getting the best bang for your buck. It can also alert you to price drops and coupons for items you're interested in.” This looks like delivering on Google Allo’s intent that floundered given its inability to properly combine its assistant and messaging. Google isn’t unique, of course. Telegram has chatbot options, including ChatGPT front-ends. But for most everyday users, that’s a step beyond what’s comfortable. Google is home turf. The really interesting question is how will Apple and WhatsApp respond. Clearly, there are elements of Siri integration into iMessage, albeit that’s limited to messaging itself. It’s not a direct comparison, but would be easily enough enabled. WhatsApp is positioned more interestingly within Meta’s stable. It’s clear that Meta will be able to bring something like this to WhatsApp easily enough. Because Google fronts the world’s largest and most valuable search and advertising ecosystem, it’s ready to go. But Facebook has its own network and can do the same. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are also both cross-platform and more widely adopted than Google Messages. This would be bring a new angle to Meta’s monetization. The issue, of course, is that when your AI chatbot is driven by an advertising giant, you’re risking a limited and far from independent experience—a Google search window without the immediate option to scan beyond the advertiser results. But the alternative is Samsung- or ChatGPT-like subscription charges for AI features and services. And we know that users will sacrifice a heap of privacy for “free”. AI in messaging will enable the same business model that’s behind search and many other services. Advertisers will pay to reach you, the services will be free. Many positives, clearly, but that core risk in narrowing search results isn’t the only word of warning here. Google Messages chats with Bard are not secured by end-to-end encryption, and Google (being Google) will store your data and use it to improve its algorithms. Just as with other such models, be careful what you ask. No news yet on timing, but in all likelihood it isn’t far away. According to Bard, “Google has not yet announced an official release date for Bard in Google Messages, but it is expected to be available sometime in 2024.” Watch this space."

    "content": "If Telegram is installed on your phone, then there are security and privacy risks you need to understand. But a new report has just warned of an even more dangerous threat to your phone from the messaging app, and one that is getting worse. New report warns of the serious threats hidden behind Telegram’s user-friendly façade There’s nothing quite like Telegram. A messaging platform you might use with your friends and colleagues, but which is also notorious for its use by criminals and terrorists, and which has almost become an easy access version of the dark web. That is certainly the findings of a new report this week from  . This messaging app,” it warns, “has transformed into a bustling hub where seasoned cybercriminals and newcomers alike exchange illicit tools and insights creating a dark and well-oiled supply chain of tools and victims’ data. Free samples, tutorials, kits, even hackers-for-hire—everything needed to construct a complete end-to-end malicious campaign.” Guardio researched the availability of so-called phishing kits on Telegram, used to attack phones and PCs. The phishing ecosystem, they say, has been democratized. “There was a time when kits, infrastructure, and know-how, were available only on invite-only forums in the Dark web, hidden behind Tor Onion networks. Today, they are readily and publicly available on Telegram—accessible via a simple search.” If you ever wonder why your email is increasingly peppered by fraudulent mails purporting to be from your bank or service provider, then this is why. Telegram has certainly hit the mainstream. One of the world’s five most downloaded apps, its press team says, with some 700 million active monthly users. “Telegram is committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. It has played a prominent role in pro-democracy movements around the world, including in Iran, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar and Hong Kong.” Contrast that with its darker side. Telegram has become the everyday storefront for build-your-own attacks that are then launched at the kind of people using the messaging platform as if it’s just a normal application. Illicit Telegram channels Telegram always had a healthy fan base, albeit somewhat outside the mainstream. But then WhatsApp had some Facebook difficulties in early 2021, and Telegram installs soared. For a while afterwards, it seemed everyone was jumping onboard. Putting its dark web credentials to one side, the irony with Telegram is that it talks up its security and privacy credentials, but it’s not actually as secure as WhatsApp. There’s no default end-to-end encryption, your message content is protected by policy, not technology. And in a world where Google Messages and even Facebook Messenger now end-to-end encrypt by default, this anomaly is hard to look past. But while that might be a threat to your privacy, it’s not a threat to your phone. Malware for hire or purchase, on the other hand, most certainly is. Mobile phishing is soaring, given the glued-to-hand nature of our devices, the increase in remote and hybrid working, and—critically—that phishing is just easier on mobiles. As   explains, “mobile is a vulnerable blind spot—the mobile device presents a fundamentally different environment from a laptop or desktop. They can give a significant leg up to attackers who use the smaller screens, simplified interfaces, and hidden URLs to their advantage. This, coupled with our natural tendency to immediately tap on anything that comes up on our smartphone or tablet screen, gives phishing attacks a higher chance of success.” And so to Telegram, Guardio describes the ease by which “one can stumble upon… public channels, groups, and bots bustling with thousands of participants… showcasing various products and services, tips and tricks, and knowledge you once had to dig deep into the dark web even to get close to” as startling. For example, they easily found “a phishing campaign targeting millions of Facebook business accounts… This campaign utilized Telegram channels to offer hijacked social accounts of victims targeted by phishing and malware. On sale are credentials and session cookies—many of them fresh out of the oven, hacked and stolen just hours or even minutes ago, and already available for sale.”  reported on this same Telegram issue last year, warning that “common users are not the only ones who have recognized the messaging app’s handy features—cybercrooks have already made it a branch of the dark web… Phishers create Telegram channels through which they educate their audience about phishing and entertain subscribers with polls like, ‘What type of personal data do you prefer?’” Guardio’s report walks through the ease by which would-be cyber criminals can set a phishing webpage, arrange its hosting, and even send out emails that link to their scam. “Our efforts soon start to bear fruit,” they reported. “Victims fall for the trap, clicking on the link and some even proceed to log into the fraudulent bank site—our scampage. Once they do this, their bank accounts become compromised.” Example scampage from Telegram It’s not just criminality on Telegram. It’s known for housing the darkest of content, such as Hamas terror channels in the Middle East. There were reports that the platform has banned access to this content,  . In reality, the platform has been infamous almost since its beginning for shielding illicit content from authorities, playing the anti-establishment role. What has changed is its campaign for legitimacy, which has included waging a social media battle with WhatsApp over which platform is safer and more secure. So, let’s be very clear. It doesn’t matter if WhatsApp is owned by Meta. The content you send is end-to-end encrypted and you can trust its security and stability. If you have concerns that there may be metadata tracks detailing your location and contact lists, perhaps even who you have messaged and when, then use Signal. As   warned last year, “Telegram’s developers position their product as safe and protected. But in practice that’s not entirely true. The reality is that Telegram has a number of quirks that make protecting your messages a little tricky… some rather dubious features in both the messenger’s interface and general logic make it less secure than is commonly believed.” Telegram told me that “since its creation, Telegram has actively moderated harmful content on our platform including malicious tools. Moderators use a combination of proactive monitoring of public parts of the platform and user reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service.” In reality, though, Telegram fails to offer a compelling messaging option given it still does not offer default end-to-end encryption, and with its previously more hidden, darker side now so close to the surface. My advice for most users is to steer clear. You can ignore the witty X account and banter with other platforms. This isn’t a game."

    "content": "U.S. CISA cybersecurity agency warns of active attacks against iOS devices The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which operates as the self-labelled America’s cyber defense agency, is an official website of the U.S. government. So when CISA issues a warning about a security flaw that impacts Apple devices, including iPhones and is known to be under active exploitation, you’d better be paying attention. CISA has issued a warning concerning a high-rated vulnerability,  , which impacts devices running specific versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. The vulnerability is known to bypass pointer authentication, something that   is an attack vector for malicious actors that poses “significant risks to the federal enterprise.” However, that warning extends beyond just Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, according to CISA, which “strongly urges all organizations” to make a timely response to the issue. CISA is America's cyber defense agency FCEB agencies, meanwhile, have been given just 21 days to patch against CVE-2022-48618 to protect their networks against the active threat. The threat itself is an old one, thought to be dating back to at least December 2022, although it was only publicly disclosed on January 9. The kernel vulnerability is known to have been targeted by attackers in versions of iOS prior to 15.7.1 and was patched in version 16.2 of iOS, iPadOS and tvOS. It was also patched in macOS Venture 13.1 and watchOS 9.2. As my colleague Kate O’Flaherty   in December 2022, iOS 16.2 fixed more than 30 security vulnerabilities with six “in the Kernel at the heart of the iPhone operating system.” By adding CVE-2022-48618 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, CISA emphasizes the seriousness of the risk of unpatched devices to federal agencies and beyond. Binding Operational Directive 22-01 requires those agencies to “remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date” if they have been added to the KEV list."

    "title": "Is Apple’s New Vision Pro Going To Be A Privacy Nightmare?",
    "content": "Apple’s Vision Pro headset launches in the U.S. today (February 2), costing an eye-watering $3,499.  Apple’s Vision Pro headset   in the U.S. on Friday, costing an eye-watering $3,499. Many Apple fans will think the hefty price is worth it—after all, the firm’s CEO Tim Cook is convinced the iPhone maker’s device is going to change the world. “The era of spatial computing has arrived,” Cook said when announcing the headset. “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.” But privacy-conscious Apple users might be more cautious, as many are worried about how their data will be collected and shared with third parties. And the privacy implications of the Vision Pro are even more wide-reaching, tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler writes in the  . He calls the Vision Pro “a privacy mess waiting to happen,” because while Apple has put safeguards in place, there are questions about how the new device will work in practice. If you are only just hearing about the  , it’s Apple’s answer to a mixed reality headset. Apple describes the Vision Pro as “a revolutionary spatial computer” that “transforms how people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, and enjoy entertainment.” The Vision Pro does this by blending digital content with the physical world. You can get involved in “powerful spatial experiences” via its operating system, visionOS, controlled by your eyes, hands and voice. Apple also launched an all-new App Store with access to more than 1 million Vision Pro compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS. You can “interact with apps by simply looking at them” and tap your fingers to select, flick your wrist to scroll and use a virtual keyboard or dictation to type. While it comes with many cool features, the Vision Pro could also be a privacy risk. “Imagine you’re in a waiting room, and someone sits next to you with four iPhones strapped to their forehead. You might swiftly relocate,” Fowler writes. “Yet that’s exactly what’s happening when someone straps on Apple’s new Vision Pro headset. Each of these goggles contains the rough equivalent to a head full of iPhones: 2 depth sensors, 6 microphones and 12 cameras. It uses them to continuously track people and rooms in three dimensions — every hand gesture, eyeball flick and couch cushion,” Fowler adds, noting that it “collects more data than any other personal device I’ve ever seen.” He highlights concerns brought up by privacy researchers, who question who will get to access the maps these new devices build of people’s homes. For example, having a 75-inch television could suggest you have more money to spend than someone with a 42-inch set. The Vision Pro can understand objects, so in theory it could detect if you’ve got a crib or a wheelchair or even drug paraphernalia. All of this data would be very attractive to advertisers and data brokers, or even the government, experts suggest. It’s a scary warning, so what steps are being taken by Apple to restrict data collected by the Vision Pro? Thankfully, there are many, including safeguarding information such as what people’s eyes are looking at. There is also an indicator on the front screen which shows when it’s recording—allowing you to jump out of the way if you see someone with a device coming in your direction. Eye tracking information isn’t shared with Apple, third party apps or websites. This means   can’t access the camera to capture photos and videos, so they can’t run facial recognition on people. FaceTime conversations are end-to-end encrypted by default, which means no one can access them, even Apple or the government. Apple describes on its developer   how the system handles camera and sensor inputs without passing the information to apps directly. “Instead, the system enables your app to seamlessly interact with a user’s surroundings and to automatically receive input from the user.” Similarly, the system provides a way to automatically alter a view’s appearance when someone looks at it, without an app ever knowing what the user is looking at. “In the few cases where you actually need access to hand position or information about the user’s surroundings, the system requires you to obtain authorization from the user first.” It’s also important to point out that, as even Fowler admits, his concerns are speculative. Apple is pretty active in the privacy space and the iPhone maker will always want to protect its brand. Apple has been approached for comment and I will update this article if the firm provides a statement. You might be thinking about buying the Vision Pro, now or in the future. So is it really a privacy nightmare like Fowler says? The first thing to consider is, it’s new technology and the risks are likely to materialize as the device is used. Fowler, like everyone else, can only guess at what could happen in theory. In general, everyone should be wary of new data-collecting devices. “It is packed with sensors, cameras and microphones so could be a nightmare to control in terms of privacy,” says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. He says there’s the potential for “a magnitude of information which can be monitored and analysed from using this device.” There are of course security risks to consider, too—cyber criminals will be looking for holes to exploit in Apple’s Vision Pro. But it’s also worth noting that Apple is keeping on top of  , with the first patch for the Vision Pro already  , even before it was launched. The bottom line is, if you really want to buy the Vision Pro at launch, do so with caution—as you should when purchasing any new type of tech. Safeguards are in place, but it’s worth considering when and where you use it, ensuring you are careful to read the privacy policy before you use it."

Jean Carroll’s defamation trial against former President Donald Trump was canceled for the day on Monday after a juror was sent home sick,     report, delaying the ex-president’s defense as he faces paying more than $10 million damages—though his attorney told the court Monday he does hope to take the stand when the trial resumes. Former President Donald Trump leaves his apartment building in New York on Jan. 22, on his way to  Carroll’s trial against Trump was due to enter its second week, after the writer accused Trump of defamation after he denied her rape allegations against him in 2019, declaring Carroll “wasn’t my type.” U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan canceled the trial until Tuesday after a juror in the case was sent home sick. Trump’s attorney Alina Habba also reported feeling ill and was exposed to Covid after dining with her parents three days ago, CNN  , though Habba and her co-counsel tested negative on Monday. Trump’s attorneys were due to start presenting their defense Monday and the ex-president was present in court; it was possible he could have taken the stand and testified. Habba told Kaplan Monday that Trump does plan to testify in the case, but asked that he be allowed to do so on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, due to New Hampshire’s primary election, multiple    . Kaplan has not yet ruled on that request. The trial is expected to resume at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, though it’s possible there could be further delays if other jurors become ill or Habba tests positive for Covid. Once the trial resumes, Carroll’s lawyers are expected to call one final witness to testify and then Trump’s attorneys will start presenting their defense, which they’ve told the court should take approximately two days. $10 million. That’s how much Carroll is asking the jury to award her in compensatory damages, as well as an unspecified amount of punitive damages meant to deter Trump from defaming her in the future. The trial will only determine how much Trump has to pay in damages, after an earlier trial on separate but similar allegations already   the ex-president liable for defamation and sexual assault. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $5 million in that case. What will happen if and when Trump testifies. Because Trump has already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault in the previous trial, Kaplan ruled ahead of this trial that Trump and his lawyers can’t claim that he doesn’t know Carroll and didn’t assault or defame her—as the ex-president has continued to frequently allege outside of court. While Habba’s said in court filings that Trump can still testify about other things, like his state of mind when he made the statements about Carroll, if Trump does start going off and criticizing Carroll, it could result in the judge—who’s already threatened to throw him out of the courtroom—taking action against him, like holding Trump in c0ntempt. Legal experts have advised that Trump testifying isn’t likely to bode well for the ex-president, the Washington Post  , with white-collar defense attorney Robert Katzberg telling the publication, “Even if you had the most pro-Trump judge in America overseeing the trial, Donald Trump should not testify. Multiply that by a million with Lewis Kaplan on the bench.” Carroll alleged in 2019 that Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s, leading Trump to declare he’s “never met this person in my life,” Carroll is “not my type,” and the incident “never happened.” Carroll   Trump for defamation in November 2019, and   in in November 2022, alleging sexual assault under New York’s Adult Survivors Act, which gave adult victims of sexual assault a one-year window to file litigation even if the statute of limitations had expired. That case went to trial first—as the first lawsuit got held up by Trump unsuccessfully claiming he couldn’t be sued because he was president when the statements were made—and resulted in the jury   in Carroll’s favor. This second trial began on Jan. 16, and Carroll has already  , claiming on the stand that Trump “shattered [her] reputation” and the then-president’s comments “ended the world that I had been living in.” Trump’s lawyers have been arguing at trial that Carroll wasn’t as damaged by Trump’s comments as she claimed, pointing to attacks she received before Trump criticized her and the publicity she’s gotten from going public with her allegations.

    "title": "Iron Ore And Coal Miners Riding High On China’s Economic Stimulus",
    "content": "The price of steel in Asia is at risk of a steep increase thanks to unexpected strength in the price of iron ore and an upward surge in the cost of coking coal which remains an essential commodity for most steel makers. Iron ore had been expected to trade below $100 a ton this year but since dipping to $98/t last May it’s been largely one-way traffic, briefly touching $144/t last month before slipping to $130/t and now said by Citi, an investment bank, to be heading back up to $150/t. Iron ore from Australia being unloaded in China (Photo by Jie Zhao/Corbis via Getty Images) Fortescue, the leading pure play iron ore miner in Australia, touched a 12-month share price high earlier today at A$29.95 ($19.46) thanks to the iron ore rally which is being largely driven by Chinese Government economic stimulus. Coking coal has also been on a roller coaster ride, falling to $248/t in the middle of last year before rising to sell this week for $318/t and said by Morgan Stanley to be heading up to $340/t. The combination of higher prices for the two primary ingredients in steel, iron ore and coking coal, is a perfect recipe for an increase in the steel price which, in turn, could feed into inflation. On iron ore, Citi said last week that economic stimulus in China had sparked a rally across base metals (such as copper and zinc) as well as iron ore. “We see these measures as positive and can see the risk rally continuing over the coming month on the back of further details regarding urban village redevelopment and anticipated total social financing figures,’ Citi said. “In addition, we expect fundamentals to turn more price supportive over Chinese New Year in mid-February.” Australian open cut coal mining. AFR Picture by ROBERT ROUGH (Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty  If iron ore’s price increase is a function of rising demand, the increasing price of coking (or metallurgical) coal is largely a function of insufficient supply. A combination of limited development of new mines thanks to government and environmental opposition to coal and wet weather in Queensland, Australia’s major coal mining State, has fed into the coal price. Seasonal flooding in Queensland’s coal regions has limited some exports of premium-grade coking coal keenly sought by steel mills. Queensland flooding to git coal exports. (Photo by Peter Wallis/Getty Images) Two years ago, heavy rain forced the closure of major rail lines, driving the price of coking coal up to a record $635/t, close to double where it is today. A major beneficiary of the latest price increase is Whitehaven Coal which is in the process of acquiring two coking coal mines from BHP in a deal which has seen Whitehaven’s share price rise by 20% over the last six months. Morgan Stanley said coking coal volumes from Australia have been in decline for four years, largely a result of declining capital expenditure since 2015 with miners finding it harder to sustain production let alone expand. “Coal has been increasingly losing favour in the competition for capital against other mineral commodities,” Morgan Stanley said. But a result of limited investment in new production and a rising commodity price has seen the financial return on coking coal for miners of the material reach a 15-year high. “Given Australia’s position as the lowest cost producer, dwindling investment there has called for growth from higher cost sources, such as Russia and notable Mongolia,” Morgan Stanley said. “Fragile supply comes at a time when demand shows no sign of faltering. “Global hot metal (steel) production, the driver of coking coal demand, was up in 2023 (+0.5%) with India’s expansion gathering pace (+7.3%) and China posting growth as well (+0.7%). “Continued momentum in India’s growth story should have a positive bearing on coking coal given India’s high import dependency. “We see upside to prices from here as this plays out against an increasingly stretched supply base.”"

    "title": "Biden Arms Greece So Greece Arms Ukraine. Republicans Can’t Stop It.",
    "content": "A Greek air force C-130. As the Republican Party’s blockade of aid to Ukraine drags into its fourth month, the U.S. government under Pres. Joe Biden has found a clever new way to give Ukraine’s forces the weapons and ammunition they need to defend their country. It is, in essence, an American version of Germany’s circular weapons trade— . The United States is gifting older surplus weapons to Greece with the understanding that Greece donates to Ukraine some of its  surplus weapons. Greek media broke the news last week. According to the newspaper  and other media, the Biden administration offered the Greek government three 87-foot  -class patrol boats, two Lockheed Martin C-130H airlifters, 10 Allison T56 turboprop engines for Lockheed P-3 patrol planes plus 60 M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and a consignment of transport trucks. All this hardware is U.S. military surplus—and is available to Greece, free of charge, under a U.S. legal authority called   Federal law allows an American president to declare military systems surplus to need, assign them a value—potentially zero dollars—and give them away on the condition that the recipient transport them. The law caps annual EDA transfers at $500 million. The same law   dictate the  the president assigns to surplus weapons. In a letter to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken   the ships, planes, engines and vehicles as “free concessions.” The EDA gifts to Greece sweeten a larger arms package that includes 40 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, which Greece is buying for $8.6 billion. The Biden administration previously approved, in 2022 and 2023, $60 million in financing for arms-purchases by Athens. In exchange for this largess, the Americans want the Greeks to donate more weapons to the Ukrainians. “We continue to be interested in the defense capabilities that Greece could transfer or sell to Ukraine,” Blinken wrote. The Americans even offered a reward once the donation is complete. “If these capabilities are of interest to Ukraine, and pending an assessment of their status and value by the U.S. government, we can explore opportunities for possible additional foreign armed forces financing of up to $200 million for Greece.” The Greek military operates, or holds in storage, an array of Soviet- and U.S.-designed weaponry that would be of immediate value to the Ukrainian military—in particular, S-300 and Hawk long-range air-defense batteries, Tor and Osa short-range air-defense vehicles and ZU-23-2 air-defense guns. Also: ammunition for all these systems. Some or all of those weapons could be heading to Ukraine. “Political and military leadership has already given the necessary directions so that obsolete systems and equipment that are no longer used by the Greek army are transferred to Ukraine,”  . The Greek ring-transfer was a delicate one, as tensions between Greece and Turkey mean the United States usually offers both countries new weapons at the same time—and in roughly the same quantity. So it’s no accident that, simultaneous with the Greek arms deal, the U.S. State Department cleared Turkey to spend $23 billion on 40 new Lockheed F-16 fighters and 79 upgrade kits for older F-16s, plus munitions for the fighters. The deal also was a reward for Turkey finally consenting to Sweden joining NATO. Germany’s  program has speeded to Ukraine scores of tanks and other heavy weapons. America’s  ring trade could do the same—potentially on an even grander scale. Greece isn’t the only country with old weapons that it might give away, if the United States offers something in return. That Biden and his secretary of state Blinken are backing an EDA-based ring-trade should come as no surprise to close observers of American politics. Last fall, pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress made it clear they probably never will approve direct military aid to Ukraine. The Republicans are falling in line with disgraced ex-president Donald Trump’s personal hatred of Ukraine—and equally personal fondness for authoritarian Russia. The Republicans’ allegiance to Trump—and therefore to dictators and military aggressors—wasn’t an issue for Ukraine until they narrowly gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2022 elections. When earlier funding for Ukraine ran out in late December, Rep. Mike Johnson—the extremist House speaker—refused to put additional aid to a vote. So barring a legislative breakthrough, Biden can’t get the additional $61 billion in clean funding he wants for Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean he can’t honor the wishes of the majority of Americans and help Ukraine to defend itself. Biden’s EDA authority is one of several legal mechanisms at his disposal that can free up older weapons for onward transfer to Ukraine. And while Biden could send excess defense articles directly to Ukraine, he initially is using EDA as leverage in ring trades. Expect more of this as Republicans and Trump increasingly side with Russia in Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine. The Republicans might be eager to betray Ukraine; Biden however  ."

The research team thinks that the 26 billion record database, found on an open storage instance, will likely have been compiled by a malicious actor or data broker. “Threat actors could leverage the aggregated data for a wide range of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts,”  . As well as data from Chinese messaging giant Tencent and social media outfit Weibo, records from users of platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram is also to be found in this database. Worryingly, the researchers also say that records from an assortment of U.S. and other government organizations can be found. If there is good news to be found in such a discovery, it is that little of this appears to be new data. Instead, the researchers say, it’s more a case of compiled records from thousands of previous breaches and data leaks. What’s more, there are undoubtedly a large number of duplicate data records within this compilation. The inclusion of usernames and password combinations does, however, still mean this is a cause for concern. I’d expect a surge, if current levels aren’t high enough, in credential stuffing attacks over the coming weeks as a result. “We should never underestimate what cybercriminals can achieve with such limited information,” Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET, says. “Victims need to be aware of the consequences of stolen passwords and make the necessary security updates in response,” Moore continues, “this includes changing their passwords, being alert to phishing emails following the breach, and ensuring all accounts, whether affected or not, are equipped with two-factor authentication.” Although the data from this latest breach and leak compilation discovery has yet to be entered, you can use this free   at CyberNews. This will reveal earlier instances where your email address has been leaked, including some of the services from the MOAB database. You can also use the free  service as well. Above all else, though, don’t panic. If you maintain good credentials hygiene, using strong and unique passwords that are not reused elsewhere, as well as two-factor authentication where available, you should be safe. If you don’t, now is a great time to start."

    "title": "Google Issues Surprise New Warning For Samsung Galaxy Users",
    "content": "Android users may have plenty to look forward to, with Google   radical new AI releases. But a new update warning has suddenly started hitting Samsung Galaxy devices, which is reportedly annoying users and raising serious questions on timing. Google’s ‘annoying’ warning now being seen on Galaxy devices While it’s Apple making   over its App Store changes in response to Europe’s DMA—including aping Android’s sideloading to some extent at least, it seems that Google is also tightening up its traditionally relaxed approach. Starting last year, Google has been warning owners of its Pixel devices when they download Google apps from anything other than its Play Store. As  reported at the time, this new update ownership “lets third-party app stores become the exclusive source of future automatic updates to an app they first installed.” But now,  reports that “Google has expanded warning dialogs for sideloaded app updates to non-Pixel phones and non-Google apps.” This “annoying 'update ownership' warning” will be a surprise for users who expect to install what they want from where they want, trading risk for flexibility. This has always been the draw for Android, making it so different from Apple’s locked down iPhone. The warning itself links back to the concept of app ownership introduced with Android 14. Essentially, an app store can mandate provenance over an install, triggering a warning if an update is requested from elsewhere. While this ostensibly relates to integrity and functionality, there’s clearly a major security angle as well. While the warning dialog is not alarming, it will be unexpected and not something owners of Samsung and other Android devices expect to see. “This is our first clear indication,”  points out, “that Google is ready to spread these warnings beyond Pixel phones and Google apps/services.” Ordinarily, this story might slip by with little passing interest. The warning appears just once—it’s more an inconvenience than anything else. While this   started to appear on non-Google devices for non-Google apps, it’s not yet widespread and so will not yet have “annoyed” the likely millions of impacted users. A Google spokesperson told me that \"we introduced several new APIs in Android 14 that allow app stores, including third-party stores, to improve their user experience.” The warnings are not device specific and relate to the app store concerned. “When you install an app from a store, you typically expect to receive automatic updates for the app from that same store. With Android 14, if a store claims responsibility for future updates for the apps you install through it, then Android ensures that you won't unexpectedly receive updates for these apps from a different store.” I was told that “as stores, including Google Play, adopt the Android 14 change, users who subsequently update apps from different sources may notice this message.” But from the outside, the exact timing of this remains notable, just as Apple trades headlines over the security and privacy risks—or not—in sideloading, with regulators reportedly watching its own DMA-induced implementation with interest. As my colleague Kate O’Flaherty reported on  , “iOS 17.4 will be welcomed by iPhone users in the EU who would like the same flexibility Google’s Android users enjoy. But Apple has warned that sideloading and the associated changes to iOS and its ecosystem as a result open up iPhone users to major security risks.” In the last few weeks, I have reported on the latest wave of Play Store malware plaguing Android devices. First SpyLoan, then Xamalicious, and finally a research note warning about the scourge of “copycat apps.” Each of those warnings covered some limited Play Store installs, but primarily concerned the much less secure and controlled third party stores. This is the balance that Apple says it now needs to strike. Providing the seeming competitive freedom demanded by the EU, while maintaining its security credentials. Apple genuinely does need to navigate a path through this. While prompted by good intentions and instincts, I suspect most iPhone users are wary of lessening the famed security credentials of their devices. Arguably, users can choose the locked down iPhone or open Android ecosystem. That choice in Europe is now diminished. “We’re trying to strike a balance,”   of Google’s own efforts in this area—but taking a different angle to Apple. “We believe in choice,” he said, “so on Android we allow you to sideload and install additional applications.” But Pichai also sounded a warning that there’s a user risk in stepping outside the formal channels, where it has focused significant resources in recent years in shoring up security. It’s just like a seatbelt, he said. Users can choose to use them. or not. Until now, there has been a clear divide. Apple has a blanket ban on sideloading, and Google is pretty open. It has not been possible to directly compare and contrast the security and protections available, given those different approaches. But now it’s all change, and for the first time the playing field has been somewhat leveled. And so we watch with interest to see what Apple delivers in practice—and how that lands with regulators, and then how Google responds. Which is why the timing of this latest warning is interesting and why this story is worth watching as it develops."

    "content": "Apple’s iOS 17.4 update will see the iPhone maker open up its app store and iOS ecosystem to outside parties for the first time ever. In a game-changing move, the iPhone maker will comply with the EU   by allowing app side-loading from March when iOS 17.4 launches, Apple said in an  . The change coming in iOS 17.4 will be welcomed by iPhone users in the EU who would like the same flexibility Google’s Android users enjoy. But Apple has warned that   and the associated changes that need to be made to iOS and its ecosystem as a result open up iPhone users to major   risks. Apple’s iOS 17.4 update will see the iPhone maker open up its app store and iOS ecosystem to outside  Many experts agree. The beauty of iOS from a security and privacy perspective is the closed ecosystem approach, which contrasts with Android’s open marketplace. Because Apple owns the hardware and software of iOS, the iPhone maker has far better control over security. From iOS 17.4, this will change for EU-based users, but Apple says it is doing all it can to keep you as safe as possible. The Digital Markets Act aims to boost competition by preventing tech giants such as Apple from acting as “gatekeepers” dominating the marketplace. From iOS 17.4 Apple is adding new options for distributing iOS apps from alternative app marketplaces “including new APIs and tools that enable developers to offer their iOS apps for download from alternative app marketplaces.” It will also add a new framework and APIs for creating alternative app marketplaces, “enabling marketplace developers to install apps and manage updates on behalf of other developers from their dedicated marketplace app.” It addition, developers will be able to use browser engines other than WebKit, for browser apps and apps with in-app browsing experiences. Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. This includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area, Apple said. In the EU, Apple is also introducing new controls that “allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app—or an alternative app marketplace—as their default.” Apple said the changes coming in iOS 17.4 will be available in the EU, but what exactly does that mean, given that the UK is no longer a member? According to reports, the UK will be exempt from the changes, for now at least. In its press statement, Apple described how the new capabilities “will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.” Those 27 countries are: The EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. But the UK does have its own version of the DMA, the UK Digital Markets Bill, which is going through approval at the moment and could eventually force Apple’s hand. As you might have gathered, Apple isn’t particularly happy about the changes. And sideloading won’t be openly available,   reports. Apple is instead maintaining an element of “walled garden” by allowing only certain app stores it calls “App Marketplaces” to distribute apps. These must follow Apple’s rules and stipulations. Meanwhile, Apple will check your device is eligible for sideloading changes via a system dubbed “country”, which combines information including your Apple ID billing address, location country, region set in iOS Settings and what type of device you are using. As 9to5Mac notes, the system also checks whether the device comes from China to restrict sideloading—although it’s not clear why. You will be able to see the region of your device via a new section in the “About This iPhone” menu, with additional details about the system to become available in an as-yet-unpublished support article on Apple’s site. Other requirements under the DMA include changes to Apple’s Safari browser. While iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser as their default, Apple needs to go further to comply with EU rules. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements to ensure users know there is a choice, Apple said it is also introducing a new choice screen, which will pop up when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. “That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options,” Apple said. Apple says a more open ecosystem that comes with the DMA means it has less ability to address other risks, “including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content.” Apple says its anti-tracking feature,   will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store. “However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features—including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy—will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.” The “one golden security measure” keeping iPhones safe is the fact apps are downloaded from within Apple’s App Store ecosystem, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. “Opening this up to unchecked third parties would potentially enable threat actors to use Trojan horses and malware within apps to target devices,” he warns. Sean Wright, head of application security at Featurespace is more conflicted about Apple’s iOS 17.4 changes. “The closed ecosystem does initially appear that it would be more secure and less prone to malicious apps, but this isn’t always the case.” In addition, Wright concedes that there hasn’t so far been “a significant issue” with the ability to install apps from other locations in Android.” Apple said in its announcement that it is introducing new safeguards to boost security. These include   for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers and disclosures on alternative payments. It says this will “reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU.” However even with these safeguards in place, “many risks remain,” Apple said. It’s not ideal for security-conscious EU iPhone users—many of whom use Apple devices because of their secure by design credentials. From iOS 17.4, people need to be more mindful of where the apps they download are from, Moore says. “Savvy Android users have been used to this since the beginning, but now Apple users will need to do more due diligence in order to protect their devices and data.” When making purchases through third-party markets, users should be mindful that they are providing their payment information to third parties, says Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky’s GReAT. “Apple has stated that it will not be in a position to issue refunds in such cases.” When iOS 17.4 does launch, Wright thinks most people will still stick to the official app stores. “This certainly would be my recommendation for users,” he says. I agree. While the iOS 17.4 changes are a huge change for EU iPhone users, it’s still possible to keep your iPhone secure. Check all apps before downloading—including the reviews—and if you are worried, limit your downloads to Apple’s official App Store only. —"

    "title": "iMessage And WhatsApp Soundly Beaten By Radical Google Messages Update",
    "content": "The Google Vs Apple Vs Facebook battle on your smartphone is about to take an exciting new twist; if you’re an Android user, Google has just revealed a huge AI upgrade that could change the way you use your device. Google’s latest release will be a game-changer The tech giants behind the most popular smartphone OS and app ecosystems have spent years battling for your messaging loyalties. And for good reason. There are no other apps as sticky as WhatsApp or iMessage or Google Messages. They are the center of your social network, to which you return through your day, every day. And so, just as Samsung   for its own smartphone AI offerings, here comes Google with something more game-changing. How about incorporating Bard directly into its core messaging platform. A readymade UI and user base. No new apps to install or complex productivity app extensions to master. This is ChatGPT-like simplicity, pre-installed on every Android smartphone. Google has spent two-years pushing its Messages app as the default Android alternative to iMessage. This has included end-to-end encryption and RCS by default, and multiple feature releases. Now, with that done, here comes an AI upgrade that connects Messages users with Google, not just with one another. According to Bard itself, this “promises to be a game-changer for how we communicate. It's an AI assistant that can improve your messaging experience in various ways, from facilitating communication to enhancing creativity and providing information… It will be your personal AI assistant within your messaging app.” There were hints last year that Google might be looking at bringing Bard into Messages, albeit nothing substantive. But having unpicked the latest pre-release APK,   now   that Bard is indeed “coming to Google Messages to ‘help you write messages, translate languages, identify images, and explore interests’.” There are a raft of obvious tasks this could simplify—creating a recipe or drafting a text for your boss are two of the examples given. But that just scratches the surface of the real opportunity, which (for Google) is much bigger. When ChatGPT was released, you’ll remember the   that came thick and fast. The future of web search was not going to be browser-based. It would be interactive and chatty. Google’s patchy rush to release Bard followed. To begin, you’ll likely experiment with AI text composition, image recognition, simple information requests—but make no mistake, AI chatbot driven search is the prize ( , ). The AI models need more advanced structuring to turn chat into workable commerce requests, but the end will justify the means/investment. According to Bard, “it can be your handy shopping sidekick in several ways… It can suggest thoughtful and unique gift ideas… It can compare different models, highlight key features and specs, and find reviews and ratings from real users… It can scour online stores and social media to show you what's hot and where to find it… It can track prices across different retailers to ensure you're getting the best bang for your buck. It can also alert you to price drops and coupons for items you're interested in.” This looks like delivering on Google Allo’s intent that floundered given its inability to properly combine its assistant and messaging. Google isn’t unique, of course. Telegram has chatbot options, including ChatGPT front-ends. But for most everyday users, that’s a step beyond what’s comfortable. Google is home turf. The really interesting question is how will Apple and WhatsApp respond. Clearly, there are elements of Siri integration into iMessage, albeit that’s limited to messaging itself. It’s not a direct comparison, but would be easily enough enabled. WhatsApp is positioned more interestingly within Meta’s stable. It’s clear that Meta will be able to bring something like this to WhatsApp easily enough. Because Google fronts the world’s largest and most valuable search and advertising ecosystem, it’s ready to go. But Facebook has its own network and can do the same. WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are also both cross-platform and more widely adopted than Google Messages. This would be bring a new angle to Meta’s monetization. The issue, of course, is that when your AI chatbot is driven by an advertising giant, you’re risking a limited and far from independent experience—a Google search window without the immediate option to scan beyond the advertiser results. But the alternative is Samsung- or ChatGPT-like subscription charges for AI features and services. And we know that users will sacrifice a heap of privacy for “free”. AI in messaging will enable the same business model that’s behind search and many other services. Advertisers will pay to reach you, the services will be free. Many positives, clearly, but that core risk in narrowing search results isn’t the only word of warning here. Google Messages chats with Bard are not secured by end-to-end encryption, and Google (being Google) will store your data and use it to improve its algorithms. Just as with other such models, be careful what you ask. No news yet on timing, but in all likelihood it isn’t far away. According to Bard, “Google has not yet announced an official release date for Bard in Google Messages, but it is expected to be available sometime in 2024.” Watch this space."

    "title": "Future Of Energy: How Solar Power Is Fueling The Cryptocurrency Boom",
    "content": "HILLSBOROUGH, NJ - JULY 15: Employees of SunEdison install photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of  How much energy does it take to mine Bitcoin ? This question often sends shivers down the spine of environmentalists who have always rallied against crypto mining. Regulators already frown upon the existence of cryptocurrencies, and major thinkers across the US are mulling over introducing a  . It might seem unfair, but these inflated emotions seem justified when you look at the stats: CoinGecko   that a solo miner would require 266,000 KwH to mine 1 Bitcoin. Now that the halving is upon us, this number will increase. Amidst environmental fears, skeptics often ignore one thing: According to CryptoSlate, more than   of Bitcoin mining relies on renewable sources of energy. Furthermore, more than 23% of it is done using hydropower, and over 7% of those renewable mining operations rely on solar power according to the same source. This percentage might not be that low for long. There have been concerted efforts to make solar energy more viable, with some conglomerates already setting up mining operations that harness the power of the sun. How much impact has solar power had on the cryptocurrency market? Let’s explore the nuances of solar-powered crypto mining and see how this future of energy might push the crypto adoption rate. Solar-powered crypto mining is now seen as more viable than ever, and there are many reasons for this. First, solar energy is clean and abundant. If harnessed properly, it can power whole mining operations without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. However, harnessing such energy comes at a cost. According to Finbold, considering a standard 400w solar panel, powering one mining rig will require  . But, this is easily curtailed since panels are now becoming more affordable thanks to the clean energy incentives introduced by the  . In fact, the cost of harnessing solar power has been falling for a long time. Shawn Rumery, senior director of research for the Solar Energy Industries Association,  , “Over the last decade, prices have come down by over 50% in the residential space.” Another big plus of using solar-powered mining is independence from the grid. It reduces the risk of power outages, causing less disruption to mining operations. This has resulted in Bitcoin mining becoming a new niche in the solar business. New players who want to engage with the crypto market in an affordable way are finding that investing in solar panels is a good way to go about it. For instance, in late 2022,   announced the launch of the world’s first solar-electric crypto mining rigs. Other companies, such as  ,  ,  , and more, are also trying to bring sustainable crypto-mining solutions, many of which use solar energy. Major investment companies are also rallying behind Bitcoin mining firms that leverage solar energy. For instance,  , a Bitcoin mining company that uses solar power for its mining operations, raised   in 2022. Now, the perks of solar mining won’t be limited to providing a clean ecosystem to mine; it can also encourage more investment into solar-powered systems. In the  ,   wrote, “Bitcoin mining could encourage investment in solar systems, enabling renewables to generate a higher percentage of grid power with no change in the cost of electricity.” They further noted that this can allow energy providers to “play the arbitrage between electricity prices and bitcoin prices.” This statement denotes a symbiosis between the two concepts — bitcoin mining and solar energy — paving the way for both sectors to prosper. These points are just the tip of the iceberg of reasons to be bullish about solar-powered Bitcoin mining. However, achieving a full transition to using solar energy is not easy. It is easy to ignore the realistic flaws of using solar-powered mining when benefits are all we want to see. Here, let’s discuss some of the key challenges people are going to contend with when implementing solar-powered mining. It all starts with the upfront cost of running a mining operation. While I already highlighted that solar panels are getting affordable, we have to ask ourselves if they are cheap enough. The truth is, we still have ways to go in terms of mass affordability. In an effort to highlight the cost-related challenges of solar-powered mining, I reached out to CEO of  , Rich Feola. “A full transition to solar energy for mining Bitcoin is going to be difficult,” he shared. “For now, individuals need to install multiple solar panels to run a single mining rig. As mining rigs become more energy efficient, we might see some growth, but it would be foolhardy to think that a complete transition to solar-powered Bitcoin mining will be coming so soon.” According to Architectural Digest, the national average cost of a solar panel is  . Considering the large number of solar panels to power a mining rig, an individual would be set back by more than $700k well before starting a mining operation. Solar energy is abundant, but it is also intermittent. For a solar panel to generate enough electricity, the sun should be bright and high. That means panels will not generate as much energy on cloudy days. Even though a high-voltage battery can be installed alongside the solar panel to store energy, don’t expect that power to last long during the rainy season: Solar batteries may not have enough capacity to constantly supply power to a mining rig. Another big challenge is having the space to install the panels. According to Freedom Solar Power, Bitcoin miners would need anywhere between   to power one formidable mining rig. A wider area is required if clouds are properly considered. If one buys the area to install solar panels, there will be additional upfront costs to deal with. And if that space is rented, the mining operation will have massive overhead to be paid monthly. The latter choice could put a severe dent on the profits made from Bitcoin mining, which is a big issue considering its volatility. Considering the upfront costs and space-related requirements of solar-powered mining, another big factor we must look at is whether mining Bitcoin is worth it. Bitcoin is an inherently volatile asset. Even though   is coming and more market leaders, such as Cathie Wood, are inclined to believe that it might reach  , chances of it happening are not set in stone. Furthermore, there are concerns about whether Bitcoin mining will be profitable after the halving. According to  , an American financial services firm,   may not be profitable once the upcoming halving arrives. Beyond halving, we must consider the other factors dictating the price of Bitcoin. Many countries don’t have any regulations in place to properly govern crypto yet, and those that do aren’t fond of the uncertainty this asset brings. Further, there is the community’s sentiment to consider, which changes on a whim. For instance, spot Bitcoin ETF approval was seen as a golden event that would bring institutional investors and pump the  . Instead, the value of the world’s leading crypto went from $46k to $42k when the approval happened. While these challenges make people think twice about the prospect of solar-powered Bitcoin mining, one cannot deny its eco-centric appeal. Furthermore, there are cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin that are aiming to make solar energy more accessible. Since it became clear that investors are veering towards solar energy and other renewable resources for their mining needs, multiple cryptocurrency projects have emerged to make renewable energy more viable.  is a leading project that rewards users for generating solar energy. For every one MwH energy generated, this project rewards miners with one SolarCoin. This incentive-based model acts as a motivator to make solar energy more mainstream. On the other hand, more large-scale projects like   seek to democratize renewable energy by allowing households, organizations, and even grids to trade energy. Such initiatives can create a symbiotic relationship between cryptocurrency and renewable energy resources. A growth in one could mean growth for the other. As crypto miners move towards renewable energy sources, solar energy is slowly catching their attention. Abundant and clean, solar power can make crypto mining more independent and affordable. However, it is equally important not to be blind to the challenges of solar-powered mining. Upfront costs are still high, the cryptocurrency market is still volatile, and there are only a few places where the sun shines bright and high enough to properly power a solar battery. Thankfully, certain cryptocurrency projects have entered the scene to make renewable energy more democratized. They are working in tandem to create a crypto boom in the market. But how loud will this explosion be? Only time will tell."

    "title": "Bumrah Emasculates England as India Seize Control In Second Test",
    "content": "TOPSHOT - England's Ollie Pope is clean bowled by India's Jasprit Bumrah (not pictured) during the  The sound of the death rattle is a batsman’s worst nightmare and a bowler’s most beautiful dream. When Jasprit Bumrah begins to reverse-swing the ball and then move it back in with just a loose-limbed switch of the wrists, there isn’t much the opposition can do. That includes an imperious Ollie Pope and a well-set Ben Stokes. Bazball was bullied in the face of a six-wicket Bumrah blast as India seized a 171-run lead on the second day in the . It was hard not to feel sympathy for James Anderson who had bowled superbly in the morning session to remove double centurion Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravi Ashwin. Five hours later, he was running an exhausting quick single with debutant Shaoib Bashir, a man 21 years his junior. No wonder he trudged grumpily off the pitch to face more time in the field, England's veteran opened the bowling with a look of 'what am I doing back here?' When Rohit Sharma crashed him away in the first over, that was the final insult. England had motored to 114-1 at five an over and were in green fields of beauty with Zak Crawley threatening to produce another daddy hundred rather than one of his pretty 50s. The opener was flying on a wave of exhilaration that sweet timing brings. After hitting a boundary from the previous ball, why not do it again? Crawley miscued to point and the narrative changed. Bazball's risk management has improved, as it did in the Ashes when 2-0 down, but when putting the pedal to the metal. That is the strength and weakness of this England artillery. Duckett had played nicely for 21 and was going along a strike rate of over 100. The assurance in the batting ranks was still apparent with Pope flicking the ball over his shoulder as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Bairstow and Pope got into the 20s and were then done. Cameos don't win matches. It’s not the first time that the Surrey , but when it happens after one of the most impressive innings seen in India, it brings the stilts he was walking on crashing back down to earth. Bumrah looks amused at pretty much everything while the batsman scowls. Does that make it worse? Probably. England’s best batters were reduced to silent grief in the middle. Bumrah has Stokes’ number, which is an unlucky 13 dismissals for the England captain. Stokes had switched into a more attacking mode, as is his wont when someone or something makes him angry, but the Incredible Hulk act has had a limited shelf life so far in India. His 70 in the first Test was a lone hand before being flummoxed by Bumrah. Here, the 32-year-old was left arms outstretched again as the cherry crept under his bat to hit the stumps. Stokes rarely leaves the crease without a big theatrical reaction. Ashwin has dismissed the all-rounder 12 times too. England's Hercules is vulnerable to two bowlers and he knows it. Bumrah became the fastest Indian bowler to reach 150 wickets in only his 34  Test. He was the dominant force that marshalled a team missing its Mr Cool, Ravi Jadeja, as well as its A-lister Mr Universe, Virat Kohli. England have been subjugated by a young opener at the top of his game in Jaiswal and a world-class operator ranked fourth in the ICC bowling rankings. England are behind the eight-ball again, and while Bazball always rises to impossible challenges, the idea of an honorable defeat is probably the best they can hope for now. That’s not something that interests either Brendon McCullum or Stokes. VISAKHAPATNAM, INDIA - FEBRUARY 03: India bowler Jasprit Bumrah celebrates after taking the wicket  England don’t do disappointment.   and bravado whatever the situation. However, if they continue to be dissected and bemused by the smiling assassin, then that sense of bending everything to the will of positive intent will be lost in a sea of stumps. \"Bumrah gets into your head as a batter because you just know he can make the ball move in any direction he wants it to,\" said Steven Finn in the TNT Sports studios. That's it. That's exactly it."

    "title": "How New Bitcoin ETFs Effect The Bitcoin Price",
    "content": "A smart phone is displaying the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF stock on the NASDAQ market in this photo  The digital assets space has been fixated since BlackRock  announced its intentions to create a spot bitcoin ETF on June 15, 2023. Other companies had filed previously, but BlackRock only had one rejection out of over  , so anticipation was high. The mere possibility of the world’s largest asset manager creating a bitcoin ETF led to a 96% price rally up to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval on January 10. Therefore, it is pretty clear that bitcoin ETFs can at least indirectly affect the price of bitcoin. Yet, now we have nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., will there be a more direct impact on the bitcoin price? When investors buy or sell bitcoin on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, each trade directly affects bitcoin’s price, with the exchange’s order book matching buyers with sellers 24/7. The displayed bitcoin price is the average of what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are prepared to receive for their bitcoin. Therefore, whether an investor buys $10 or $1,000 worth of bitcoin on an exchange directly impacts the price in real time. These prices are then curated across all exchanges and trading pairs to give a global bitcoin price. Global   allow investors to identify potential arbitrage opportunities when prices differ across exchanges. These traders help ensure prices ultimately diverge toward a single value. Global combined bitcoin order book However, when it comes to bitcoin ETFs, things get more complicated. While the new spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the bitcoin price directly, they do not impact it in the same way. Buying a share of an ETF has no real-time impact on bitcoin’s price through direct means. In fact, the bitcoin represented by the share is not even purchased until the next trading day. Shares of the ETFs can only be created by organizations authorized in the issuer’s prospectus. These Authorized Participants for BlackRock include JP Morgan and Jane Street. APs submit an order for new shares to the ETF along with cash. The bitcoin reference rate is then set between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. EST and used to calculate the number of shares to issue. Once this is complete, the shares are delivered to the AP, and it can either offer them to the market or hold them on its balance sheet. When ETF shares are subsequently bought or sold, the price fluctuates like any other fund, but there is no direct impact on bitcoin. Shares can trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value when the correlation becomes decoupled. However, similar to how arbitrage opportunities across bitcoin exchanges help keep the price within a set range, bitcoin futures are often used to help keep bitcoin ETF shares in line. Whenever there is a substantial discount or premium to NAV for a bitcoin ETF, traders purchase or sell bitcoin futures on platforms such as CME to counteract the spread and collect the futures premium. Finally, to fulfill the APs’ orders, bitcoin is bought and sold over the counter with the institutional trading platform Coinbase Prime. These trades are less transparent as they are not included in the global combined order book. While transfers in and out of Coinbase Prime can be traced on-chain, internal off-chain transactions are not made public. The trades are peer-to-peer, with entities exchanging large amounts of bitcoin at a mutually agreed price. Public awareness of large bitcoin sales, such as those made recently by Grayscale, can make investors wary. However, the opaque nature of these large OTC trades and their lack of integration into global order books reduce their overall market impact on the bitcoin price. While there is sufficient liquidity at present to manage ETF demand within OTC desks, this may change in the future. The absolute maximum supply of the Bitcoin network is set at 21 million coins, and thousands of bitcoins enter ETFs daily. Conversely, only 900 BTC is mined every day, which will fall to 450 BTC within the next 80 days, following the next halving. If demand continues, the fixed supply of bitcoin may make it harder to create new ETF shares. At this point, the ETFs could substantially affect the bitcoin price, as ETFs may have to source bitcoin directly from exchanges. Ultimately, the effect on the bitcoin price will play out over months and years, not hours and days. The short-term anticipation and excitement for a spot bitcoin ETFs was perhaps overstated. However, the long-term impact may have been wildly understated."

    "title": "Lebanon's Economic Rebirth Through Bitcoin",
    "content": "TOPSHOT - Lebanese demonstrators wave national flags during a demonstration on the sixth day of  According to the  , the situation in Lebanon is regarded as one of the \"most severe global crises since the mid-nineteenth century.\" This has arisen from three decades of imprudent fiscal and monetary policies, leading to the currency's decline by over 95 percent of its value before this downturn. The currency is in a state of collapse, corruption is widespread, and the banking sector is in turmoil. Samar Hawa of   has seen how these challenges have pushed the Lebanese people into difficulty. Reflecting on the nation's resilience, Samar notes, \"The Lebanese, like a Phoenix, rise from the ashes. It's beautiful but sad.\" This sentiment resonates with the mission of Rebirth Beirut, an initiative committed to supporting Lebanon in its time of economic crisis and societal rebuilding. The Lebanese Pound, also known as the Lebanese Lira, has undergone an devastating depreciation, leaving citizens like Samar contending with the erosion of their life savings. As of October 17, 2019, even USD deposits were not spared and transformed into what locals have termed 'Lollars,' a phrase coined by a Lebanese economist. This meant that in practical terms, having $100 in the bank equated to being able to use it as only $10, highlighting the stark devaluation and financial reality facing the country. This situation not only underscores the crippling financial crisis but also serves as a glaring example of third-party risk, as banks faced insolvency after a bank run. It exposes the hazards associated with centralized policymaking that may not always align with the best interests of the people. Despite four years of chaos, Lebanon still lacks a capital control law and effective crisis management measures. In contrast, bitcoin offers a clear alternative with its core principles of self-custody, empowering individuals to access their funds without the need for external permission. Its transparency mitigates the risk of arbitrary policies that could devalue currency, and its immutable and reliable consensus mechanism ensures a decentralized and secure financial system, eliminating the vulnerabilities of a single point of failure and significantly reducing the likelihood of fraud. Photo by Keystone The Lebanese economy, often swayed by political shifts, faced a shock in 2019. The government's proposal to hike taxes on essential services sparked nationwide protests. In response, the banks shut, trapping people's funds and leaving many, except for the few very influential people, mainly the bank owners and the \"Tier 1\" politicians, unable to access their savings. This event led to a significant devaluation of bank deposits, with people's savings losing a considerable portion of their value overnight, plunging the economy towards collapse. The  , which was at 1,500 LBP per dollar in October 2019, had devalued to 141,000 LBP per dollar in March 2023 and stands at around 89,000 LBP per dollar today, witnessing an overall devaluation of approximately 98.5%. For the first time in Lebanon's history, the country defaulted on its debt in March 2020. This was followed by the devastating   on August 4, 2020, which further plunged the country into social and economic distress. Lebanon's public sector, riddled with corruption, has been unable to provide even the most basic services, including proper healthcare, retirement plans, 24-hour electricity, drinkable water - people install large water containers to stock water for times when it is not provided by the government - maintenance of infrastructure, proper waste disposal, and more. Yet, in this darkness, bitcoin offers an interesting use case. Georges Haddad, previously working in Investment Management in Canada, returned to Lebanon following the financial collapse to help rebuild his country and started  , a seed phrase storage solution company that highlights the benefits of self-custody. He sees bitcoin as a solution, \"The moment you start understanding bitcoin, you see how broken money is. It's broken everywhere,\" he states. \"Lebanon, with its deep economic scars, is a testament to the fragility of fiat currencies.\" Many Lebanese remain unbanked or have faced forced de-banking due to the financial crisis. Bitcoin  also addresses the challenge of hoarding cash at home. Those with surplus income and savings have lost trust in the banking system and often need help opening foreign bank accounts due to international regulations. Bitcoin is a hedge against rampant inflation, which has plagued Lebanon in recent years with staggering estimates. It provides a means to circumvent illicit capital controls and restrictions imposed by the banking sector. In this context, stablecoins are used as an interim measure, offering easy access to dollar, serving as a stepping stone amid the crisis. Rebirth Beirut, an initiative born from the rubble, have recently started receiving bitcoin   to help fund their initiatives. These donations help fund projects such as installing cables from private generators to light up the streets. Georges draws parallels between Lebanon's collapse and the potential downfall of larger economies globally, albeit at a slower pace. \"Lebanon could only be five to ten years ahead. It can happen in a blink of an eye,\" he warns. In the past, Lebanon's banking sector was considered a pillar of economic stability, the \"Switzerland of the Middle East.\" But years of mismanagement and corruption have eroded that trust. This combination of pictures created on June 29, 2020 shows the black market rate, as calculated by  This crisis, while unique in its specifics, is symptomatic of a global issue with fiat currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, offers an alternative. Georges envisions a future where bitcoin doesn't just operate as a currency but as a wake-up call to the perils of unchecked money printing and centralization. Georges believes Lebanese expatriates will play an important role due to them being responsible for a large portion of the nation's remittance inflows. With $6 billion a year sent home, bitcoin’s low fees and fast transaction times present an attractive alternative to traditional banking. Lebanon's case is ripe for bitcoin adoption, driven by expatriates and a general distrust of centralized authorities. The country's rich and largely unexploited energy resources – sun, wind, hydro, and potentially gas – offer fertile ground for bitcoin mining. This industry could bring much-needed stability, wealth, and potentially contribute to the decades-long electricity problem. Samar and Georges share a cautious optimism for their homeland. The path forward is fraught with challenges, but the promise of bitcoin and the spirit of the Lebanese people hold the key to a rebirth. \"I am hopeful as a person.\" says Samar, \"While the road ahead presents challenges, I am encouraged by the efforts of   and the private sector which not only contribute to the restoration of infrastructure but also revive hope. This foundation of resilience and innovation instills optimism in me regarding the future.\" In Lebanon's struggle, bitcoin is more than a financial asset; it's a symbol of change, a testament to the power of innovation, and perhaps the country's first step towards a future where the currency is as resilient as its people."

Users on the Google Pixel   sub, and Google’s community  , are complaining that they can’t access their local files, play any media or open the camera app. Pixel users say the issues started after the January Google Play system update, with the Pixel 7a, Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro reportedly affected, On Reddit, one user said this is similar to the bug that was identified in October. “The symptoms are all the same - internal storage not getting mounted, camera crashes, Files app shows no files, screenshots not getting saved, internal storage shows up empty in ADB Shell, etc.” The original thread poster, on the Pixel community forums, said “I received the January 5th security update a while back and not had any problems, but today I received the January 1st Google Play System Update and it has wreaked havoc on my Pixel 7a.” In a follow up they said that they had fixed the issue by factory resetting their phone, but this is an extreme solution. The original bug was related to people having multiple user profiles on their phones, as Google explained at the time. “We are aware of an issue occurring on some Pixel devices (Pixel 6 and later models) that have both received the Android 14 update and have multiple users (other than the primary user) set up. Multiple users include users, guests, restricted profiles, and child users. However, it does not include having more than one Google account within the primary user or work profiles.” The difference with this new bug is that some affected users suspect that it is related to having a secondary work profile on their devices. It’s not clear what is causing the problem, or if it’s the same bug that was identified and fixed last year, but Google told  that it is investigating the issue. Google’s last update solved the problem and restored storage access for most users, which took a couple of days to roll out. But more seriously affected users who were caught in a constant boot loop may have had to use Google’s Pixel Repair Tool to “recover partial data for devices that are repeatedly rebooting,” as the company  . This is a specialised solution for people who can’t boot Android on their phones because of the original fault, so it may be a potential solution for anyone experiencing similar because of the new bug."

    "title": "UFC Vegas 85 Results: Winners And Losers From Dolidze Vs. Imavov",
    "content": "LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - FEBRUARY 03: (L-R) Nassourdine Imavov of Russia punches Roman Dolidze of Georgia  The UFC was back at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas for Saturday's UFC Vegas 85 fight card. In the main event, Nassourdine Imavov, who was the No. 11 fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings, scored a majority decision win over the No. 8 ranked Roman Dolidze. Meanwhile, the evening's co-headliner saw Renato Moicano return to action for the first time since November 2022 to score a unanimous decision victory over Drew Dober. Below we look at the winners and losers from the UFC Vegas 85 fight card, which streamed in its entirety on ESPN+.  Nassourdine Imavov had an excellent first round against Roman Dolidze in their UFC Vegas 85 middleweight main event. However, because of the effort he put toward finishing the fight inside the first five minutes, Imavov did not have much to offer over the next four rounds. Despite his output dipping over the last 20 minutes of the contest, Imavov did enough to get a majority decision win. Saturday’s victory will elevate Imavov standing in the UFC middleweight rankings as he entered the bout at No. 11 and Dolidze was No. 8, but it’s hard to say just how much of a jump he will make in the 185-pound rankings.  Renato Moicano did an excellent job of taking Drew Dober out of their lightweight scrap early in their UFC Vegas 85 matchup. He did this via takedowns and a heavy top game. However, Dober was able to get back into the fight following a takedown of his own in the second stanza. Then, a failed takedown attempt from Dober in the third round was the opening Moicano needed to change the tide of the scrap and give Moicano the decision to win. Moicano, who had not fought since he submitted Brad Riddell in November 2022, was the No. 13 fighter in the official UFC 155-pound rankings heading into this fight. He should be in line for a top-10 opponent in his next outing. Wow. Randy Brown snapped a double jab to the head of Muslim Salikhov and followed that with a perfectly timed and placed right hand that put his opponent down and out at the With the win, Brown has quietly moved to 6-1 in his past seven outings. His only setback during that time was a February 2023 setback to the rising Jack Della Maddalena.  Natalia Silva continued climbing the  . Silva was No. 9 on those rankings heading into her UFC Vegas 85 matchup against the No. 7 ranked Viviane Araujo. Silva, who turned 27 on fight night, used her speed and ability to mix up her striking techniques and targets to pick up the win. The rising Brazilian, who was my   on this card, struggled at some points to get off the cage when Araujo put her there, but she did enough work in the open to pick up the victory. There are still questions about how Silva will fare against well-rounded fighters with strong defensive striking and wrestling skills, but Silva has yet to face a fighter who can impose their will on her inside the Octagon. With the win, Silva, a former Jungle Fights flyweight champ, moved to 5-0 under the UFC banner. She should face a fighter inside the top five of the division in her next outing. Gilbert Urbina did his best to keep Charles Radtke as far away from him as possible. The reason for Urbina’s approach became clear when Radtke landed a perfect left hook to drop him to the mat with 45 seconds left in the round. Urbina got back to his feet, but a second left, with 15 ticks left on the clock, brought the fight to its abrupt end. With the win, Radtke moved to 2-0 in the UFC and he is now on a six-fight winning streak.  Molly McCann   before dropping to strawweight for her UFC Vegas 85 matchup against Diana Belbita. McCann looked excellent in her first UFC contest at 115 pounds. She was aggressive from the start of the fight and threw all her strikes with bad intentions. McCann used a power takedown to get the fight to the mat, and from there, she set up a nasty armbar to end the bout at 4:59 of the first round. The victory ended a two-fight losing skid for McCann. Both those defeats came via first-round submission. UFC Vegas 85 was a bounce-back performance for McCann, who was on a three-fight winning streak between September 2021 and July 2022. Charles Johnson was in deep trouble in the early going of his flyweight scrap opposite Azat Maksum at UFC Vegas 85. Maksum dropped Johnson in the first round and nearly finished him with a D’arce choke, but Johnson adjusted his style ahead of the second round, and that was all he needed to get the decision win. Johnson forced Maksum to come to him for the final 10 minutes of the contest while landing solid counter-strikes. Johnson also was close to wrapping things up with a choke against the fence late in the fight. Johnson looked excellent in the last 10 minutes of this matchup. The win ended Johnson’s three-fight losing skid.  Themba Gorimbo was aggressive in the opening moments of his fight against Pete Rodriguez, landing a powerful overhand right that put Rodriguez on the mat. The ground strikes that followed left Rodriguez looking to wrestle with referee Herb Dean, who had stepped in to end the fight at 32 seconds of the first round. The win was Gorimbo’s second career knockout victory and first since 2019 under the EFC banner. Gorimbo was a -245 favorite over Rodriguez, who was competing for the first time since he knocked out Mike Jackson in October 2022. After his stoppage win, the 33-year-old said his goal is to become the UFC welterweight champion in 2024.  Jung Gyeong Lee looked excellent in dismantling Blake Bilder at UFC Vegas 85. The 28-year-old was calm and confident throughout the fight. He took advantage of small openings, including landing a nasty knee when the two separated along the fence in the first stanza. Lee’s striking was on point throughout the fight, and his takedown defense left Bilder frustrated and ineffective. Another thing that stood out in this featherweight matchup was that Lee never overextended himself when he had Bilder hurt. He did not waste energy or time pursuing a finish that might not have been there. Lee is a fighter to watch in the 145-pound division.  Luana Carolina fought off three submission attempts in the third round of her flyweight fight opposite Julija Stoliarenko to pick up a late finish via ground strikes. With the win, Carolina moved to 4-3 in the UFC. An awkward striker with a lanky frame, Carolina is on a two-fight winning streak. Carolina came in overweight for the bout, tipping the scales at 128 pounds, which takes some shine off her victory. MarQuel Mederos looked slightly uncomfortable early in his UFC debut matchup opposite Landon Quinones. However, he quickly adjusted to his foe's offense, countering Mederos' strikes well while landing more volume in the final 10 minutes of the lightweight scrap, which was enough to give him the decision win. Mederos needs work on his offensive clinch work. He didn't have much to offer in close as far as wrestling or striking.  Roman Dolidze had little to offer in the way of offense against Nassourdine Imavov. He didn’t land more than eight significant strikes in any round and finished the fight with a total of 34 significant strikes landed. He also did not register a single takedown or submission attempt during the 25-minute scrap.  Drew Dober looked like he was on the way to a comeback win over Renato Moicano, but an ill-advised takedown attempt put him on his back halfway through the third round. That ended any hope of Dober picking up the win.  Muslim Salikhov put together a five-fight winning streak between 2018 and 2021. However, since then he has gone 1-3 with two knockout losses, including his loss to Randy Brown on Saturday night. Salikhov turns 40 in early June. His future does not look bright.  Viviane Araujo knew what she had to do to win this fight, negate the time and space Natalia Silva uses for her striking. She did that for prolonged periods of the bout, but she failed to generate any offense from in close, which cost her the fight. With the loss, Araujo fell to 1-3 in her past four outings.  Diana Belbita didn't seem fazed by Molly McCann's power and aggression in the opening moments of their UFC Vegas 85 scrap. Her game plan seemed to be to weather the early storm and then see what McCann had later in the contest. Unfortunately for Belbita, there was no later as McCann submitted her with one second left in Round 1. Azat Maksum had a fantastic first round against Charles Johnson. He dropped Johnson in the first stanza and nearly had a D’arce choke submission. However, Maksum and his team did not adjust to Johnson’s style in the final 10 minutes of the fight. That inability to change things up left Maksum with his first career defeat. Maksum has talent, so seeing how he responds to this defeat will be interesting.  Julija Stoliarenko is a specialist. Of her 11 career wins, 10 have come via armbar submission. She almost had an 11th submission victory on Saturday against Luana Carolina, but her opponent fought off those attempts and picked up a third-round TKO finish. Stoliarenko needs to become a more well-rounded fighter. Her 2-5 record in the UFC shows that her specialty is ineffective at this level. She needs to evolve her fight game.  Landon Quinones fell to 0-2 in the UFC with a decision loss to MarQuel Mederos at UFC Vegas 85. Quinones did some good work early with his striking from distance, but once his opponent figured out his timing, Quinones struggled. If Quinones had more output, the ability to take the fight to the mat, or could have landed some strikes in the clinch, he might have picked up the win in the lightweight scrap.  Thomas Petersen had a decent first round in his UFC debut, scoring a takedown and some ground control time against Jamal Pogues, but he didn’t have much to offer his foe on the feet. Petersen had opportunities to take over the fight, but his lack of offensive striking, his weak striking defense, and his lack of a backup plan hurt him in a big way. Petersen needs a lot of work if he hopes to have a long stay on the UFC roster.  Jamal Pogues was a better striker than his opponent, Thomas Petersen in their heavyweight scrap. Pogues used that striking, distance control and some takedown defense to pick up the decision win. Pogues needs to work on his conditioning, takedown defense, and ability to get back to his feet once he hits that mat. The 28-year-old heavyweight is a work in progress, and he needs to improve if he wants to get off the prelims of UFC Fight Night cards."

    "title": "Houston Rockets Acquire Veteran Big Man Steven Adams",
    "content": "PHOENIX, ARIZONA - JANUARY 22: Steven Adams #4 of the Memphis Grizzlies saves an out-of-bounds ball  The Houston Rockets had been rumored all season to be in search of a center to backup starter Alperen Sengun. On Thursday, they got their man. He just won’t be available to play for the Rockets until the 2024-2025 season. The Rockets sent three second round picks to the Memphis Grizzlies, along with the expiring contract of Victor Oladipo, in return for veteran center Steven Adams. Adams, 30, is on the books through just next season, when he is slated to earn $12.6 million. Stevens remains unavailable for action for the duration of the 2023-2024 season as he continues to recover from knee surgery. Apart from the draft capital, the trade allows the Grizzlies to shed Stevens’ salary from the books next season. The Rockets, on the other hand, add a physical presence to their lineup and bolster their bench heading into next season. Houston had been relying upon 37-year-old veteran forward Jeff Green to fill the backup center void for much of this season but it had become apparent that size off the bench was Houston’s greatest need. The move may indicate that Rockets brass will approach this season patiently and not look to make an aggressive move with an eye towards the play-in. At the same time, the team is still armed with the expiring contracts of Jock Landale, Jeff Green, and Jae’Sean Tate (team option), as well as draft picks owed from the Brooklyn Nets in the next several seasons, including what is looking like a lottery pick this summer. After the team chased Brook Lopez in free agency this past offseason, Sengun has entrenched himself as the team’s starter at the position, also cementing himself as the team’s first option on offense. The challenge for Rockets head coach Ime Udoka this season has been the drop off when Sengun has gone to the bench. That challenge may continue through the end of this season, but the hope is that Adams’ addition will be a solution next season. Following the trade, per Spotrac, Houston’s total cap allocation on the season is $146.4 million, still significantly below the 2023 $165.29 million luxury tax threshold. The real decisions for Rockets brass start this offseason when Sengun and third-year-guard Jalen Green both become extension eligible."

    "title": "As Ukraine Runs Out Of Ammo, Russian Artillery Gunners Get Cocky",
    "content": "A Ukrainian 2S3 howitzer. When U.S. aid to Ukraine ran out in late December and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress refused to vote on Pres. Joe Biden’s proposal to spend another $61 billion on the war effort, Ukraine’s artillery batteries were the first to feel this betrayal. That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

Sure, many fans in Birmingham, AL chanted his name, and were excited to see an unannounced appearance by The Rock. But as the dust settles and this storyline marinates, it’s leaving a very bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths. WWE posted Rock’s latest return on YouTube, and it’s a good thing YouTube disabled the dislike button, because fans are making full use of the toxic tool. The Rock is threatening to steal Cody Rhodes’ WrestleMania spot, and the comment section  “Felt so out of character when Cody left the ring. You win the rumble, almost beat Roman last year, wants the title for his father.. but gives it up to The Rock? Sad,” said one user to the tune of 23,000 likes. “71,000 likes, and 267,000 dislikes. If that doesn't tell you how the people feel about this bs [sic], then I don't know what else will,” read one comment. As of this writing, the   have swelled to 281,000. “Cody couldn't say he's more CM Punk without having the full Dwayne experience,” read one comment. “What was all that about, “Cody needs adversity?” What adversity has the Rock faced in the two years Cody’s been back? Hollywood championship indeed,” one user astutely pointed out. “The Rock taking advantage of his creative position to be the main event, sounds like Hulk Hogan.” Finally, one user wrote “Vince may have been gone, but his spirit lives on.” Terms like “Poor Cody,” “WE WANT CODY” and   are trending on Twitter. As I  , The Rock inserting himself in a WrestleMania main event as a Board Member is a bad look, and is certain to turn him heel. After years of Cody Rhodes vowing to finish his story, and fans with him every step of the way, Cody Rhodes willingly rented out his book to The Rock. Like a bleached-blonde book club. Whether WWE knows it or not, the expiration date for Cody to finish his story is WrestleMania 40. Not a second after. Now is not the time for Rhodes to get writer’s block because a   wants to headline WrestleMania. That’s just bad storytelling. Many are comparing Rhodes’ situation to the Daniel Bryan story. While there are similarities, this is worse. Much worse. In 2014, WWE didn’t have Daniel Bryan figured into its WrestleMania plans at all. Bryan wasn’t even included in the 2014 Royal Rumble, so the “Yes Movement” became an organic groundswell of support for Bryan, which ultimately became undeniable. In Rhodes’ case, WWE has trained its fans to believe that Cody is finishing his story. Even after Rhodes shockingly failed to defeat Reigns at WrestleMania 39, fans remained in support of the American Nightmare, knowing he’d finish his story at WrestleMania 40. With WWE now balking at the finish line, it is in danger of ruining one of its best modern-day storylines. The fallout could be disastrous, with fans likely to turn on Rhodes—not to mention Philadelphia turning on the WrestleMania 40 main event between  A   suggested WWE could be planning to unify the belts at SummerSlam, with presumed WWE world heavyweight champion Rhodes competing against whomever the WWE Undisputed Universal champion is coming out of WrestleMania. This is a terrible idea. Through Reigns’ scathing promo on SmackDown, WWE already defined the WWE World Heavyweight Championship as a second-place world title.   When Rollins was begging Rhodes to challenge him for the WWE World Championship on Raw, fans chanted “no!” As evidenced by CM Punk and Rollins himself, injuries can happen between now and SummerSlam. Most importantly, by then the bloom may be off the rose for Cody Rhodes’ story."

    "title": "Jusuf Nurkic Has Been A Welcome Fit With The Phoenix Suns’ Big 3",
    "content": "The Phoenix Suns acquired Jusuf Nurkic and Grayson Allen in a cost-effective trade that has worked  The Phoenix Suns followed one big splash with another when they committed about $475 million to Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal in recent trades, but their most cost-effective deal has largely slipped under the national radar. Not only did the Suns acquire starting center Jusuf Nurkic and starting wing Grayson Allen for center Deandre Ayton from Portland in the three-team trade that also sent Trail Blazers’ guard Damian Lillard to Milwaukee two days before the start of training camp, they  Nurkic and Allen were instrumental in helping the Suns play through the early-season injury absences of Durant, Devin Booker and Beal, who have started together in only 18 of the Suns’ first 46 games. Nurkic, a 7-footer, has provided the physical presence in the paint on both ends of the floor that the Suns were unable to coax out of Ayton in his five seasons in Phoenix. “‘Nurk’ has been wonderful,” Suns coach Frank Vogel said. “I couldn’t speak loudly enough about the role he has played. The guy is doing what is asked of him, without the need to get more shots or more touches or anything like that.” Nurkic has received  and 10.3 rebounds in 45 games and is on pace for his fifth career double-double season, but it more his rebounding/passing/court awareness that has made him a good fit. Ayton, the first overall pick in the 2018 draft, recently told reporters in Portland that he has “nothing to prove in this league. I’m a max player, and I’ll continue to be a max player,” he said, apparently equating salary with productivity. Suns' center Jusuf Nurkic bangs with Indiana Pacers' big man Jalen Smith. (AP Photo/Matt York) The Suns did not always see it that way. Ayton, also 7-0, averaged a double-double in Phoenix and showed a nice shooting touch from the foul line in, especially when he and Chris Paul perfected their two-man game. Yet Ayton was seldom a physical presence inside, often out-rebounded by shorter but more aggressive players such as Montrezl Harrell. On a team with 20-point scorers Durant, Beal and Booker, Ayton’s point production became superfluous this season. A different complementary component was required. Ayton was was benched in the playoffs two years ago for inattentiveness on defense, and his deficiencies also seemed to alienate teammates. That the Nurkic trade was a money-saver for owner Mat Ishiba only made it that much more valuable. The Suns took on about $93.7 million in salary in adding Nurkic, Allen, forward Nassir Little and guard Keon Johnson, but they were able to get out from under   max contract that runs through 2025-26. Nurkic has two years and $37 million remaining on his four-year deal. “High IQ,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said in evaluating Nurkic. “With the attention that those three (Durant, Booker, Beal) get, he’s a guy that is really good in the pocket. Over his time in his career he’s stretched his range to three-point range. And obviously, he’s a handful on the glass. He’s really good offensive rebounder.” Nurkic has contributed in multiple ways. He played a particularly physical game against Denver center and 2023 MVP Nikola Jokic on Dec.1, with 31 points and 11 rebounds. Nurkic and Jokic went body-to-body on three consecutive paint possessions in the third quarter and Nurkic scored on a pair of inside moves. The Nuggets won, 119-111, but the Suns noticed. “Just playing basketball,” Nurkic said. “Trying to use my strength, and trying to be who I am as big as I am.” Jusuf Nurkic has been an effective distributor in his first season in Phoenix. (Photo by Michael  Nurkic also flashed to the right spot when a Suns’ side inbounds play broke down in the final seconds of a 115-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 22. He took the inbounds pass when Durant was covered and deftly threw a quick bounce-pass back to Durant, who made a game-winning, double-clutch jump shot. “Probably a guy who doesn’t get enough credit for his passing,” Donovan said. “He plays in the middle of the floor and he has really good vision. He connects a lot on the second (weak) side and really generates shots for guys, because with Durant and Beal and Booker, when you send two on the ball and the ball gets into the pocket for him, he is really a very, very good playmaker from there.” Nurkic is not always on the floor late in games. The Suns have used small lineups when matchups dictate, such as in the 119-117 victory over Sacramento on Jan. 16 and a 118-105 victory over Miami last week. In those games, 6-11 Durant moved up to cover the opposing big, and the switch enables the Suns to put five shooters on the floor. The Suns have worked the matchup the other way, also. Nurkic had 28 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in 30 minutes in a 136-120 victory over the Brooklyn Nets last Wednesday, diving to the basket against over-matched Nic Clayton inside. Vogel, known as a defensive-mind coach, has been pleased with Nurkic’s play on that end. “He has really grown defensively from the standpoint of attacking everything that comes to our basket,” Vogel said. “Rim protection is as much as mindset as a talent, and I think he has really grown with that. “He’s had some opportunities in games where he hasn’t had opportunities to score or to facilitate, and some games he doesn’t touch the ball as much. He just goes out, feels the game out, and plays around the other guys. That type of unselfishness should not go unnoticed. We’re really pleased with what he’s brought to the table.” Jusuf Nurkic has provided a defensive presence in the paint. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)"

    "content": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 03: Julio Rejon, driver of the #55 NS-GGG Racing Team -JV  NASCAR moved its Clash exhibition race up a day and ran the main event Saturday instead of Sunday as was scheduled along with a NASCAR Mexico race that was also slated for Sunday. The change came due to the forecast of incoming inclement weather and what NASCAR said was out of concern for fan safety. The weather is expected to worsen overnight Saturday into Sunday with the chance of flooding and high winds. The storm is the second one in Southern California after a similar one hit the area on Thursday causing localized flooding. The National Weather Service   \"the largest storm of the season\" and is expecting the storm to have \"dangerous, even life-threatening impacts.\" Los Angeles city officials held a   warning that the second storm could be worse L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said the city will have an \"all-hands-on-deck\" plan. \"There are indications that the coming storm could be as strong as Tropical Storm Hilary was in August,\"   Bass. \"We made it through Tropical Storm Hilary, and I am confident that we will weather this storm.\" The decision to move an event up a day is an unprecedented move that hasn’t happened in NASCAR. Normally weather can delay a race, and NASCAR has moved the start time up on occasion, but moving a race up a day is not something that is usually even considered. “Certainly not ideal,” NASCAR COO Steve O’Donnell said in L.A. at the Coliseum shortly after the decision was announced. “But as the weather forecasts continued to worsen, public safety, a lot of the things that were going around, a lot of different events that are going on in the community as well. “We started to review Saturday options late last night and this morning those obviously sped up,” he added. “We really applaud the Coliseum for even making this a possibility to the best of what is a really tough situation for the fans and this racing community but felt like this was the best option to keep everybody safe and still try and get both events in.” While the race was moved to Saturday night, the possibility of rain was in the forecast meant there could have been another delay. O’Donnell said they still had a plan though safety for all was still top of mind. “Then we'll push and then we'll look at, you know, what we can do tomorrow as well,” he said. “But we're going to keep the public safety in mind, first and foremost to make sure that we have what's necessary for us to let the Coliseum to get folks in and out safely.” O’Donnell said the entire staff was aware of the city’s concerns for the safety of everyone in the community and that was factored into the decision. “We're a guest here,” he said. “The Coliseum runs events all year long, so they're the experts…They certainly supported our decision and have been great in terms of, working but they're going to be challenged too. When you look at tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday of what's available, we were cognizant of that, that’s always what we want to do is to keep first and foremost the safety of everyone in mind.” O’Donnell added that the decision to move the race up a day isn’t something NASCAR will look at doing in the future and mentioned that fans have already bought tickets and had made plans to be at the Coliseum on Sunday. “We're going to be reaching out to every single fan,” O’Donnell said. “To see what we can do to make it good on their end. But this was our best option for us to at least see some racing.” O’Donnell admitted that with refunds, and the loss of a prime-time TV spot NASCAR will take a financial loss. “It certainly hurts, it's not going to be great, right?” O’Donnell admitted. “Nor from a ratings standpoint. “But in terms of what could have been at the end of the day, it's what's the right thing to do, and what's the right thing to do to keep everyone safe and this is that decision.”"

    "content": "Dozens of cats disappeared during the holidays as the shocked inhabitants suspected a serial “tueur  This time, the crime occurred in the small town of Montreuil-Juigné near Angers in western France’s Loire Valley, where more than 40 cats disappeared over the holidays as the shocked inhabitants suspected a serial “tueur de chats” — cat killer — in their midst. For weeks in this town of 7,000 residents, police fielded several reports of the disappearance of  — some of which were then found dead either by poisoning or brutal beating. “When the number of missing cats rose, the local gendarmerie launched an investigation and animal shelters issued alerts, warning cat owners to keep their pets indoors,” reports  . Early this month, a man in his twenties was identified and arrested thanks to a video surveillance camera installed in the wall of a house that, on December 22, filmed him in the act, bringing an end to the month-long crime spree. “My neighbor’s pet had disappeared a few days before Christmas,” the video-camera-endowed pet owner told  . “He was found dead in a trash can. Then, we see the man arriving around 2:30 a.m. with a flashlight. He calls our cat and as soon as she is at his feet we see him pick her up and put her in a bag. Our cat was found at this man’s house. She had been beaten to death with a board.” The suspect, who lives in the town, confessed to killing some 20 cats in Montreuil-Juigné. He now faces five years in prison and a fine of €75,000. According to local newspaper Sud Ouest, “he had been rampant in the (area) for several months” as mysterious disappearances of cats kept happening in the region. The investigation is still underway. A window frames a French cat.  The case of Montreuil-Juigné’s cat killer is far from isolated. Similar cases have been reported across France and, in fact, in other European countries, with some infamous “serial cat killers” becoming symbols of other French social issues and inspiring art works. for example, is a well-known book of essays by American historian Robert Darnton first published in the mid-1980s. The book's title comes from its most famous chapter detailing the \"massacre\" of cats by two apprentice printers living and working in appalling conditions while numerous cats, intended to prevent mice from eating paper supplies, were well treated and fed on Rue Saint-Séverin in Paris in the late 1730s. For some historians, that episode of cat slaughter serves as an early example of a workers’ protest over the condition of their labor and can be seen as a precursor to the French Revolution. A feral cat sleeping in front of a panoramic view in France From mass poisonings at a southwestern seaside resort in 2017 to the conviction of a man in 2020 for the theft, torture and murder of cats, the issue is a persistent problem, not only in France but elsewhere in Europe. Around the same time of the cat killings in the Loire, on December 31 in Spain — a country suffering in many regions from feral cats — an uproar ensued after the discovery of the bodies of more than 50 street cats apparently poisoned at the local dump where the colony was based in La Carlota, a village just outside the southern city of Cordoba. In what has been called “envenenamientos recurrentes” — recurrent poisonings — in social media in Andalucía, half the population of 500 cats registered in La Carlota and surroundings have already “disappeared,” according to  Meanwhile, in early December a female resident of Arleux, a small town in northern France, found eight cats poisoned to death in her garden, according to  . For cat owners whose pets mysteriously disappeared in Bray-les-Mareuil, a small town near Abbeville in northern France’s Somme region, the problem lies with fellow residents who clearly don’t like cats. For several months, some 20 domestic felines have died or disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Many residents interviewed by local media believe they have neighbors hunting cats. “When they see a cat, they shoot it!,” one told  . “In Bray, they don't like cats,“ he added. Some dead cats have been found with bullet marks. Over three weeks in 2022, the town of Citry in Seine-et-Marne lost nine cats, spurring locals to hang warning signs that read “Be careful, a cat killer lives in the village,” and calling for police to investigate,   reported. In 2020, a 39-year-old man from Vesoul in eastern France was convicted for stealing, torturing and killing local cats. The cat killer, a known drug user, admitted to stealing cats using a leash then stabbing them repeatedly or beating them to death with an iron bar or by throwing them against a radiator. In 2017, more than 200 stray as well as pet cats at the seaside resort of Saint-Pierre-la-Mer in Aude in southwestern France were killed over several weeks in an apparent mass-poisoning campaign, leaving the cats’ tongues blue and local residents in shock. “With the loss of animals which affects so many owners, the climate has become detestable; everyone is suspicious of everyone,” a resident told the local  . “We are all afraid that a child will one day ingest this poison about which we know nothing.” A feral cat enjoys sunset in Marseille's  famous little fishing harbor.  As the cases abound, so do the controversies. The impact of cats living outside in cities and towns is enormous for the planet’s biodiversity. Recent studies confirm the definition of the pets as “super predators” threatening many species, particularly small birds. Some countries have taken radical action to control them. Australia, for example, has decided to use new technology that fires toxic gel at feral cats as an element of the strategy to eradicate them. Killer robots identify feral cats from their silhouette and their gait, and fire poison at them. France has a cat population numbering an astonishing 14 million and their existence pose many ecological challenges, with the scientific community concerned about their impact on wildlife. A new compilation of data from more than 500 studies published on the diet of domestic or abandoned cats shows that a total of 2,084 different species of small animals could have been eaten by cats. Among them are 47% birds, 22% reptiles, 21% small mammals, a significant number of insect (6%) and amphibians (3%)."
