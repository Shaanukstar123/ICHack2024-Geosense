    "title": "Underpriced Stocks In The Small-Value Corner",
    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "content": "French soccer star Kylian Mbappé has reportedly decided to join Real Madrid this summer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, ending months of speculation that the Spanish club could land the 25-year-old superstar. PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018. Real Madrid is the most valuable soccer team in the world,  , worth just over $6 billion."

    "content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James   Thursday that Publicis Health, one of the largest global health advertising agencies, will pay   to settle allegations it “developed predatory and deceptive marketing strategies” for Purdue Pharma opioids, which the attorney general’s office called the first settlement of its kind involving an advertising agency. The settlement involving Publicis Health, a subsidiary of France-based  , was the result of a “coalition” co-led by James composed of “every attorney general in the nation,” according to a news release from her office. The agency worked with Purdue Pharma   on marketing campaigns for a number of opioids, namely “OxyContin, Butrans and Hysingla,” and used strategies that were “designed to deceptively expand” opioid usage for more patients at higher doses, the release stated. Negotiations for the settlement, which requires Publicis to pay the amount within 60 days, were led by James and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, according to the release. The advertising agency is also prohibited from “accepting any future contracts or engagements” involving opioid marketing or sale, and is required to release “hundreds of thousands” of internal documents related to its work with manufacturers and consultants. More than $19 million of the settlement will go to New York to “fund opioid abatement, treatment, and prevention,” according to the release. In a statement emailed to Forbes, Publicis Health said the settlement is “in no way an admission of wrongdoing or liability.” “This is the first settlement with an advertising agency for its role in the opioid crisis, and we'll continue to go after those who contributed to this devastation,” James said in a   on X, formerly known as Twitter.

    "title": "Billionaire Reid Hoffman Spent $2 Million On Biden’s New Hampshire Write-In Campaign, FEC Records Show",
    "content": "Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman donated $2 million to help fund the campaign urging Democratic primary voters to write President Joe Biden’s name on New Hampshire primary ballots, newly filed Federal Election Commission records show, as Hoffman has poured his resources into a string of anti-Trump efforts in recent years. Reid Hoffman speaks onstage during The AI Optimist Club at WIRED Celebrates 30th Anniversary With  Hoffman donated $2 million to the Granite for America super PAC that led the pro-Biden write-in campaign in New Hampshire, where Biden won the primary last week despite his absence from the ballot following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties over the new primary schedule. Hoffman donated almost 99% of the $2,025,000 the group raised since its inception in November, according to end-of-year   released Wednesday. New Hampshire Democratic Party Vice Chair Martha Fuller Clark, a former state lawmaker, donated the remaining $25,000. The group, founded by New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan, spent $239,826 through the end of December while a similarly named group supporting the effort, Granite State Write-In, spent $31,623 of the $56,559 it raised last year, records show. Hoffman, a longtime Biden supporter, is a prolific donor to efforts designed to boost Democrats and challenge former President Donald Trump—he helped fund writer E. Jean Carroll’s sexual assault suit against the former president, former Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) failed 2022 reelection campaign and has given millions to the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project. Hoffman also donated $250,000 to a super PAC backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s Republican presidential campaign, his political advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn told Forbes previously, and a non-profit Hoffman supports helped fund a super PAC backing former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s now-defunct GOP presidential campaign, according to the  64%. That’s the share of votes Biden won in New Hampshire, beating Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who earned 20% of votes, and author Marianne Williamson (4%). Hoffman has reportedly decided to stop giving to Haley’s campaign after her losses to Trump in New Hampshire and Iowa,  , citing a source familiar with his thinking. Hoffman said in December he donated to Haley because his “first priority is to defeat Trump,” noting she “would not be as good for America as Joe Biden, but America would survive her administration.” Hoffman is among a growing number of megadonors re-evaluating their priorities as Trump appears poised to clinch the nomination. Billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of the Citadel hedge fund and a Republican mega donor, also gave $5 million to support Haley’s campaign, but expressed doubts this week in an interview with   about the future of her candidacy. \"Her poise, admirable; her foreign policy experience, tremendous; her ability to unite this country, phenomenal,” Griffin said. “I just don't know, though, that at this moment, that's going to get her where she needs to get to in South Carolina and thereafter.” The Democratic National Committee moved South Carolina ahead of New Hampshire on this year’s primary calendar in part in a bid to galvanize Biden’s base of Black voters in subsequent primary contests. The New Hampshire Democratic Party refused to recognize the move, however, and proceeded to hold its primary in conjunction with the GOP contest last week. Biden, siding with the DNC, opted not to appear on the ballot, and the DNC penalized the state by removing its delegates. Local volunteers with the Biden write-in effort ran a grassroots campaign, largely consisting of ads and mailers, encouraging voters to pen his name on their ballots."

    "title": "Billionaire Peter Thiel Backs Doping-Friendly Olympics Rival — What To Know About The ‘Enhanced Games’",
    "content": "Billionaire PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel has   in a drug-friendly sports contest styled as a “modern reinvention of the Olympic Games,” part of a movement embracing ways science and technology can enhance human performance that critics argue endangers both athletes’ health and sport itself. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies, has invested in the Enhanced Games.  Thiel was revealed as an investor in a “multi-million dollar” seed round on Tuesday for the Enhanced Games, a privately funded sporting contest that describes itself as the “Olympics of the future.” Thiel is joined by the likes of  , a cryptocurrency investor and former CTO of Coinbase, and  , a biotech investor who said the games “will undoubtedly inspire the public’s imagination.” The Enhanced Games said it will not test athletes for drugs or other performance enhancers at its events—it is not clear when the first competition will take place—explaining it “embrace[s] the inclusion of science in sports” and is “unencumbered by anachronistic legacy systems” that are “ ” and stigmatize “enhanced athletes.” The contest   it is aiming to be the “safest international sporting event in history” and will require full medical screens on athletes competing to monitor any risks. While the “Enhanced Movement” stresses enhancements as a “personal” choice for competitors, the contest’s website says it “embraces enhanced athletes” and wants to push the “perceived limit” of what is possible, with the ultimate goal of setting new world records. Team sports have been culled from the contest to better focus on individual prowess, and events will be held across five core sporting categories: athletics, aquatics, combat, gymnastics and strength. The Enhanced Games says it is going to be the “most inclusive sports league in history.” All adults will be welcome to apply to compete in the games, organizers said, regardless of whether they are “natural, adaptive, or enhanced, an amateur or a former Olympian.” Registration will open in late 2024. Precise dates for the contest are not yet known. “Contemporary drug testing practised in sports today is not necessarily about athlete safety; it often skews the public perception of fairness and health in competitive sports,” said Michael Sagner, a member of the games’ scientific and medical advisory board and a clinician and researcher in aging and sports medicine at King’s College London. Sagner said Enhanced will adopt a “sophisticated safety protocol” that will put athletes’ health first. The Enhanced Games’ organizers say they hope to avoid the excessive waste and costs associated with the modern Olympic Games. The Enhanced Games have been designed so they can be hosted at a Division One university campus, its website said, avoiding the need to build new stadiums and push cities into debt. It will also mean athletes can be paid fairly, boasts Aron D’Souza, president of the Enhanced Games. While the Olympic Games can generate billions in revenue, successful athletes see only a   of the bounty. “By focusing on world records in popular sports such as track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weight lifting and combat sports, we can eliminate wasteful infrastructure spending and reinvest to fairly pay all athletes.” It’s not clear how much athletes competing in the Enhanced Games stand to win. The games’ organizers   an exact prize pool and compensation structure will be announced in the middle of 2024. All athletes will be paid a base salary and will compete for additional prize winnings, organizers said. By nature, competitive athletes strive to be the very best at what they do and train hard to achieve this. Inevitably, athletes look beyond themselves for ways of getting an edge, which can range from an improved diet, training at high altitudes and exploiting advances in sports medicine and psychology to high-tech gear like bikes, shoes and swimming costumes, blood doping and drugs. A number of these methods, notably using drugs, have potentially negative health consequences for athletes and are viewed as giving an unfair advantage over other competitors. While there is no clear consensus on where the dividing line is between permissible and impermissible enhancement—the boundary often changes with new scientific advances as well—high level contests frequently test athletes to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Athletes in many professional leagues can be sanctioned or barred from competition for doping, and some fans reject any   who used performance-enhancing drugs. Critics   efforts like the Enhanced Games put athletes’ health at risk and undermine the integrity and fairness of sporting competition. Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN the idea of such a contest is “farcical,” adding that it’s “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” It’s also likely illegal in many states on account of the legal status of some performance enhancers like anabolic steroids, which can help boost muscle mass, Tygart said. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was   from competing internationally for four years on Monday for an anti-doping violation from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. She had won gold in the team figure skating event, though the medal has now   to Team USA. We estimate   has a net worth of $6.2 billion. The sum positions him as the 443rd   on Forbes’ list of real-time billionaires. Thiel cofounded PayPal and big data firm Palantir and was the first big investor in Facebook.  (The Verge)"

    "title": "How Ozempic Maker Novo Nordisk Is Tackling Weight Loss Drug Shortage This Year",
    "content": "Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk will boost supplies of its wildly popular obesity drug Wegovy in the United States this year, mitigating—but likely not ending—shortages as it   but struggles to meet growing demand while expanding into new markets. Wegovy injector pens are authorized to help people with obesity.  Novo Nordisk “started gradually increasing” supplies of lower doses of Wegovy in January, the company   Wednesday, months after it throttled provisions to “safeguard continuity of care.” The company will more than double the quantity of lower doses reaching the U.S. compared to recent months, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters in a call discussing the firm’s stellar  . Novo Nordisk will also gradually increase overall supply of the anti-obesity drug throughout the rest of 2024, the company confirmed to Forbes in an email. In its  , the drugmaker said it is exploring other ways to shore up scarce supplies of in-demand medicines, adding that it has invested nearly $11 billion in expanding global production capacity. The company said it is also “thinking strategically” about how to remove bottlenecks from its supply chain, singling out disposable auto-injector pens patients use to deliver Wegovy and other medications in its catalog. In particular, Novo said it is exploring ways to reduce reliance on “single-use injection devices,” such as introducing medicines in once-weekly, rather than daily, formulations. Novo Nordisk throttled distribution of smaller Wegovy doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients. As the drug has a risk of gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, patients are started on a smaller dose that is then increased over time to reduce any risks. The restrictions, which are still officially in place after the announcement on boosting supplies, meant many new patients could not begin treatment. Jorgensen said the increased supplies mean more U.S. patients will be able to start treatment. Novo Nordisk has been struggling to meet booming demand for Wegovy for years. The drug scored regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2021 and it has been featured on the Food and Drug Administration’s shortages list   early 2022. For much of this time, Wegovy, the brand name for a GLP-1 hormone-mimicking drug semaglutide, was the only anti-obesity drug of its kind on the market and its   has pushed Novo Nordisk to secure record profits and become one of the most valuable companies in Europe. Semaglutide’s weight-loss properties have also contributed to   of another of Novo’s blockbusters: Ozempic. Ozempic also contains semaglutide but is licensed to treat diabetes, not obesity, but as it is authorized clinicians can and do prescribe it for other purposes “off label.” The U.S. is  in struggling to secure supplies of the popular drugs and   there and around the world have warned demand is helping   for counterfeits and trafficked goods. Illegal sales can be dangerous and have none of the rigorous safety guarantees pharmaceutical firms must adhere to during production, sales and shipping, such as the sterile conditions required for injected medicines. Some patients in Austria and Britain have been   after using products that may have contained insulin instead of the advertised semaglutide. 50 million. That’s how many people with obesity should be able to get healthcare coverage for Wegovy in the U.S., Novo Nordisk  . Around 10 million would access this through Medicaid and 40 million through commercial coverage, the company said. It estimates there are around 110 million adults living with obesity in the country."

    "content": "British Formula One star Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes at the end of the upcoming season and is set to join Ferrari in 2025, according to    , in what could be one of F1’s biggest moves in nearly a decade. Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

    "title": "Is The 'God's Army' Border Convoy—With Only 50 Vehicles In Texas—A Bust? What To Know",
    "content": "The “Take Our Border Back Convoy” has begun driving through the southern U.S. on its way to several planned rallies near the border on Saturday in protest of the Biden administration’s migration policies—but the protest is reportedly off to a slow start, and has so far failed to pick up the hundreds of thousands organizers originally called to attend. The convoy will hold a rally near Eagle Pass, Texas, a city that has seen a huge surge in migrants  The group, which is   “God’s Army,” was organized partly by conservative radio hosts Scotty Saks and Kim Yeater, as well as former Army Lt. Col. Pete Chambers, who promoted the convoy on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s InfoWars last week and   on Tuesday. The convoy kicked off its multi-state journey in Virginia Beach on Tuesday, and is encouraging “active and retired law enforcement and military, Veterans, Mama Bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media, and LAW ABIDING, freedom-loving Americans” to join on the road. Organizers told the   at least 700,000 people would attend the rallies—but   reported only about 50 cars, trucks and RVs joined the convoy as it drove into Dripping Springs, Texas, on Thursday, noting the group is hoping to add more drivers has seen supporters cheer them on from the side of the highway (    reported seeing just a few dozen vehicles at other stops). The group has raised about $157,000 on donation platform   (it is unclear what Take Our Borders Back plans to spend the money on, and has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy insists it will not be “going to the border,” instead simply touring the border states—though one of its major rallies is scheduled to take place at the Cornerstone Children’s Ranch, a farm located just along the border in Quemado, Texas. At least one elected official, Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas)m told local news outlets he planned to attend one of the rallies, telling   in Dallas-Fort Worth the convoy “should be a peaceful movement by the American people” (Self has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy is planning three large rallies in border states on February 3: one in Quemado near Eagle Pass, Texas, one in Yuma, Arizona, and one in San Ysidro, California. “We are ready to roll into these peaceful assemblies in three cities … and we’re going to hold elected officials accountable,” organizer Scotty Saks said in an announcement video posted on alternative video hosting site Rumble. “Our borders and language and culture are being destroyed by this open border policy … We have solid ground for doing this event.” “God’s Army” is already facing internal friction,   reported on Wednesday. According to the report, multiple tires were slashed on convoy drivers’ cars while they stayed overnight at a hotel, and a person was kicked off one of the convoy’s buses and left on a highway shoulder. Convoy organizers seem to be blaming this on “individuals and groups actively spreading misinformation and lies” from inside the organization itself. “We have some legitimate intel from multiple sources that infiltrators, provocateurs plan to attack our convoy—either on the road or at our events,” Saks said in a video post on Rumble. Saks did not provide any direct evidence of these infiltrators, but said any potential instigators will face “the wrath of the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets who will be on the ground at our event.” The convoy comes as the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate Washington. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico are at an all-time high, after agents 2.4 million encounters over the course of 2024—up more than 4% from 2022, and more than 40% from 2021, according to  . The massive influx of migrants has overwhelmed CBP and the asylum system, which Republicans blame on President Joe Biden’s border policies, though Biden has denied claims of lax border enforcement and blamed the crisis on larger factors like poverty and violence in Central America. Eagle Pass, one of the towns the convoy is preparing to drive through, has become a focal point for migrants crossing the border into Texas, eventually compelling the state government to seize control of a local park and begin installing razor wire along the border. The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration was allowed to remove the razor wire, but Texas officials have since declared they will not let the federal government access the park and will keep installing wire. Last week, Biden endorsed a bipartisan bill that would give him the authority to shutter the southern border if crossings exceed a certain threshold and hire more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to more quickly process the massive amount of migrants in the region. In exchange, the bill would authorize more military aid to Ukraine—a major priority for Democrats. Despite the fact that the bill has not yet been released, President Donald Trump and House Republicans have begun attacking the proposed legislature, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) telling his colleagues the bill was “likely dead on arrival.” This week, the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who they accuse of violating his oath of office by not enforcing border security. The committee advanced the articles early on Wednesday morning, which could lead to a full House vote on the secretary’s impeachment."

Apple CEO Tim Cook appears next to his company's Vision Pro virtual reality headset, which will  Apple tallied $119.6 billion of revenue and $2.18 earnings per share (or $33.9 billion total net income) in the final three-month period of 2023, topping average analyst estimates of $118 billion in sales and $2.10 of profit per share ($32.7 billion total profit), respectively, according to FactSet. That marks 2% revenue growth from 2022’s December quarter and 16% profit expansion, figures far more paltry than those just reported by rivals   (18% increase in sales, 33% jump in net income) and   (13% rise in sales, 52% expansion of profits). Apple’s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales—its $69.7 billion of iPhone revenue last quarter marked just a 6% annual increase but topped forecasts of $67.6 billion—and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region which accounted for about a fifth of all Apple revenue last fiscal year. Shares of Apple dipped slightly in low-volume afternoon trading, declining 4% over the last week’s standard trading hours. Apple’s lukewarm earnings report comes two days after Microsoft   its fifth-consecutive quarter of record revenue and two weeks after Apple ceded the title of the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft, a crown held by Apple since 2021. Apple’s roughly $130 billion in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat Microsoft’s $113.6 billion, but analysts project Microsoft to become more profitable than Apple by next fiscal year, a fairly remarkable feat considering Apple raked in 33% more EBITDA during the 2022 fiscal year. Wall Street expects Microsoft’s valuation ($3 trillion as of Thursday) to accordingly surge further past Apple’s ($2.9 trillion). Analysts’ average price target for Apple stock of $199 implies a projected market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, according to FactSet, while their average price target for Microsoft implies a projected market cap of $3.4 trillion."

    "content": "Boeing reported stronger-than-expected earnings Wednesday, but the report was marred by the jet maker’s recent negative headlines as the firm’s CEO surprisingly said “now is not the time” to focus on Boeing’s financial outlook amid the turbulence. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has navigated a trying month for his firm. Boeing generated $22 billion of sales during the fourth quarter, easily beating consensus analyst estimates of $21.2 billion compiled by FactSet, while its $0.47 loss per share also beat forecasts of $0.78. But as observed by Bernstein analyst Douglas Harned in a Monday preview note to clients, this quarter was “unusual” and “nothing” in the typically-tracked earnings metrics are likely to be “useful” for Boeing. As such, Boeing declined to provide guidance for 2024 sales as it typically does in its first earnings call of the year. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun explained that “now is not the time” for forward-looking financial statements as the company must “focus…on doing everything possible” to satisfy customers and regulators alike amid controversy over the safety of the company’s commercial planes,   to a memo sent to employees obtained by Bloomberg. Though Boeing was coy about its 2024 outlook, analysts project a strong year for the company. Consensus estimates of a $3.4 billion full-year net profit would make 2024 Boeing’s first profitable year since 2018, while its $89.7 billion in projected revenue would similarly be a six-year best.

Adidas shares plummeted on Thursday after the company's cautious projections for 2024. Adidas’ share price plunged nearly 9% after markets opened in Europe on Thursday, before settling at $178.5 (165.44)—down 6% from the previous day. In its preliminary   for 2023, the company projected an operating profit of roughly $540 million (€500 million) for 2024—  of analyst estimates of around $1.37 billion (€1.27 billion)—because of currency fluctuations in key markets. The sportswear giant is attempting to soften the blow as it plans to sell its remaining inventory of Yeezy footwear, valued at around $324 million (€300 million), at cost, instead of writing it off, from which it expects to generate around $270 million.

That is the total hit on revenue the company says it faced in 2023, owing to unfavorable currency fluctuations, including a “severe impact from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso at the end of the year.” The company reported net sales of $23.1 billion in 2023. During the company’s earnings call, Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden referred to the cautious projections for 2024 as a “worst-case scenario” and said: “Everything we are saying is conservative.” Gulden added: “We're trying to be humble, and down-to-earth, and then rather surprise you positively than negatively.” In 2022, Adidas joined several major brands in severing ties with Kanye West after the rapper made several antisemitic remarks on social media and interviews. West’s Yeezy-branded shoes were among Adidas' most lucrative product lines and accounted for around $1.3 billion in revenues for the company in 2022. The German sports apparel giant initially indicated it may be forced to write off its remaining Yeezy inventory, but the company moved to sell it off through drops on its website and app, resulting in $810 million (€750 million) in net sales last year.

    "title": "Why Biden Can’t Easily ‘Shut Down The Border’—As Both He And Trump Have Suggested",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump amped up his campaign Wednesday against border legislation being negotiated in Congress, claiming President Joe Biden has the immediate authority to shut down the border amid a surge in migrant crossings—but closing the border would prove legally and practically challenging, and Biden argues he can’t crack down on crossings unless Congress passes the immigration bill. Migrants attempt to cross the Mexico-United States border along razor wire, despite heightened  Trump on Wednesday called the legislation—which is being negotiated in exchange for additional aid to Ukraine—a “stupid bill” and urged lawmakers to “make sure it doesn’t get passed,” pressuring Biden to “close the southern border” and insisting there is “no bill necessary” in a Truth Social post. Trump’s campaign has caused many of his allies in Congress to sour on the border deal, and Biden, in turn, has blamed the GOP for blocking him from executing “emergency authority” to “shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed.” The term “shutdown” is likely a form of hyperbole, as closing legal ports of entry would be an extreme and unprecedented measure that would disrupt trade and U.S.-Mexico relations, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council. Instead, many Republicans have pushed Biden to crack down on unauthorized border crossings that have hovered near record levels in recent years. No administration could automatically force universal deportations for anyone caught in the U.S. illegally, however, under what Reichlin-Melnick described as “crystal clear” immigration law that grants any foreign national on U.S. soil the right to seek asylum, which is afforded to those who can prove they faced persecution in their home countries—regardless of whether they entered the United States through legal means. Republicans have suggested Biden should drastically curtail asylum claims by reimposing more restrictive Trump-era immigration policies like Title 42 (which let federal officials rapidly expel unauthorized migrants to Mexico under the Covid-19 emergency) or the “Remain in Mexico” program (which required most asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico)—but both policies are controversial and have faced legal challenges, along with resistance from Mexico. Biden argues the legislation being negotiated in the Senate would let him effectively “shut down” the border by raising the threshold for asylum and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to limit crossings to 1,400 per day if migrant encounters exceed a threshold,     reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. It would also speed up the asylum process for people who legally present themselves at ports of entry and require people caught in the country illegally to be detained while their asylum interviews are conducted, and removed within 15 days if they fail the interview, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), one of the Senate negotiators working on the deal, explained to reporters Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), echoing Trump, has claimed Biden could automatically deport anyone who was caught crossing illegally under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which Trump used to impose the controversial travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. This too is a fraught proposal, according to Reichlin-Melnick, noting that the courts struck down Trump’s attempt to prohibit people caught violating the order from seeking asylum, a right enshrined in a patchwork of international and U.S. immigration law implemented over the past 100-some years. While the details of the border-Ukraine deal being negotiated in the Senate have been closely guarded, some Republicans—even those who are in favor of aiding Ukraine, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—have expressed outrage in recent weeks that it does not include tighter restrictions on parole, which allows migrants in emergency situations to safely and legally cross the border through airports and other official means. But the timing of the stalled negotiations aligns with Trump’s sudden interest in killing it—a fact Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)   acknowledged in a meeting with the GOP conference last week, telling lawmakers “we don’t want to do anything to undermine” Trump. Johnson   the proposed Senate bill, as is, is dead-on-arrival in the GOP controlled House, citing Republican demands for a string of more restrictive policies, including the re-implementation of “Remain in Mexico,” new limitations on asylum and parole and additional border wall construction. Former DHS officials warned that curtailing crossings to the degree reportedly proposed in the pending legislation could crowd portions of the border south of Mexico, they told  , adding the measures would only be possible with Mexico’s cooperation. What’s more, is that removing anyone who is caught on U.S. soil after crossing the border illegally would require additional asylum officers to conduct what’s known as the “credible fear process,” a pre-screening to determine if their asylum claims warrant review, Reichlin-Melnick said. Immediate detention for most people caught in the U.S. illegally, as described by Sinema, could anger Biden’s base while it also threatens to overwhelm detention facilities. 52%. That’s the share of voters who trust Trump more than Biden (30%) to handle immigration, according to a Bloomberg-Morning Consult   released Wednesday. The survey found 59% of voters rate immigration as a “very important” issue in the presidential election. Immigration policy has vexed the Biden administration throughout this tenure as the number of unauthorized crossings have surged, reaching a monthly record high in December. Many of the migrants hail from Central America, Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, and have asked for asylum from political repression or rampant gang violence. The influx follows the May expiration of the pandemic-era public health law, Title 42, that allowed border agents to turn away migrants seeking asylum on the grounds that it could lead to increased spread of Covid-19. The Biden Administration also ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy in August 2022, following a protracted court battle with Texas and Missouri. Biden promised to eliminate both policies during his 2020 campaign, and there are also practical reasons why neither are likely to be re-implemented. The Mexican government has said it will not cooperate with any reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and the Supreme Court has already ruled the Biden administration had the right to end it. Title 42 is no longer applicable since the federal public health emergency expired in May. Biden has requested funding for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers and fentanyl-detection technology as part of his proposed fiscal year 2024 budget that is under negotiation in Congress."

Trump’s lawyers had argued the dossier—which came to light days before he took office—contained false, inaccurate or fabricated information about the former president and sought damages from the company for allegedly violating British data protection laws. Steyn, in a written ruling, said there are “no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed” as Trump had “chosen to allow many years to elapse -– without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction.” There is a six-year period of “limitations” that such damages need to be claimed within, Steyn reasoned, adding that the former president’s claim for damages “is bound to fail.” Steyn, who said she did not consider or determine the veracity or accuracy of the dossier’s claims, noted that the “only other remedy” Trump sought—an order to erase, or restrict processing, of his data—was “pointless, and unnecessary,” as Orbis had already deleted its copies of the dossier and it is “freely available” online anyway. In a   of the ruling, the court said Trump had “no real prospect of obtaining any of the remedies he sought.” Buzzfeed News set Washington ablaze in early 2017 when it published a   filled with scandalous allegations about Trump and his purported links to Russia.

Steele, who is British,  the decision as “reckless” and in October claimed two Russian sources had not been heard from since. Steyn said she thought Trump’s real purpose for pursuing Orbis was not for damages but as a final attempt at rehabilitating his reputation after failing for years through other means. “In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility,” Steyn wrote.

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

    "content": "An outbreak of a multi-drug resistant fungal infection in Washington state was reported earlier this week, and although infection is rare, experts warn its high mortality rate, drug resistance and ability to easily spread in healthcare facilities may be cause for concern. Optical microscope view of Candida auris. The Seattle and King County public health department   Tuesday it identified three confirmed cases of Candida auris infection last week, after an initial case was confirmed on January 10. Candida auris is a type of fungus that grows as yeast, and though it’s rare, it can cause severe illness and spread easily because it’s typically resistant to antifungal medications,   to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All four people were patients of Kindred Hospital Seattle, and the first confirmed case was detected through a “proactive screening program” during admission to the hospital, according to the news release from King County officials. The other three patients initially tested negative for the fungus when they were first admitted, though additional testing revealed they were positive, suggesting they were infected during their stay at the hospital. Local officials still haven’t identified the source of the outbreak, but they’re working with Kindred Hospital to keep transmissions down by keeping infected patients isolated, and notifying facilities that admit patients who were previously at Kindred. The CDC issued a   in May 2023 about an uptick of Candida auris cases spreading in healthcare facilities, labeling it an “urgent antimicrobial resistant threat.” 2,377. That’s how many Candida auris infections were reported in the U.S. in 2022—the year with the most up-to-date data—  to the CDC. Some 5,754 other people were found to have Candida auris somewhere on their body that same year, though they weren’t sick or had an active infection. Candida auris was first identified in Japan in  , where it was spotted in a patient’s ear secretion. The U.S. first began tracking infections in 2016, and it was discovered that cases dated back to 2013 in the country. Cases have since grown every year and have been reported in 36 states as of 2022, with the most drastic increase occurring during the Covid pandemic between 2020 and 2021, where the U.S. saw a 94% increase, according to CDC  . Around 95% of cases occurred in five states between 2013 and 2020: New York (41%), Illinois (26%), New Jersey (14%), California (8%) and Florida (7%). Around   of Candida auris strains are resistant to at least one antifungal, while 30% are resistant to at least two. Part of the reason the infection spreads so quickly is because it’s often   as a different fungus and not treated properly, and spreads easily through healthcare facilities. This is because the infection can live on surfaces for at least two weeks, according to a 2017   published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. In comparison to Covid, the coronavirus can survive on surfaces for up to  , researchers from the National Institute of Health found. Candida auris can   severe infection and hospitalization in some patients. It’s particularly deadly in healthcare patients with serious medical issues, as   people with an invasive Candida auris infection—which affects places like the heart, brain and blood—die. The fungus can cause infection in different parts of the body like an open wound or the lungs, the CDC  , though bloodstream infection is the most common. There’s not a specific set of symptoms, as it has similar symptoms to other fungal infections.   of fungal infections include fever, chills, soreness, rashes, low blood pressure, muscle aches, shortness of breath, a cough, joint pain, pain while eating, fatigue, headache or discolored, brittle nails.

    "content": "Snap, the tech company that owns Snapchat, is recalling about 71,000 Pixy Flying Cameras—all of the miniature drones the company sold in 2022—due to a fire risk posed by their lithium ion batteries. The company is offering customers a full refund for the product they discontinued after only four  According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, at least four customers have complained about the batteries “overheating and bulging,” which caused one minor fire and injured one person. The Pixy drones cost between $185 and $230, and the company is offering a full refund to all owners—even if you received one as a gift. Snap is asking drone owners to remove the battery pack and follow   for disposal, before returning the drone itself through a  . The Pixy was introduced in 2022 as Snap began rebranding itself as a “camera company” and pivoting away from its social media roots, CEO Evan Spiegel told  . Although the Pixy was   by some reviewers, the company abandoned the product after only four months. The project was scrapped as the company faced one of its worst years since going public in 2017, with stock prices plunging nearly 80% over the course of 2022 as digital ad revenue continued declining, the   reported (Snap’s stock has since recovered since the 2022 slump, climbing back up to a price of $15.75 per share in December 2023, or 76% higher year to date,   reported.) The growing popularity of devices with lithium ion batteries continues to pose a risk for sparking dangerous fires. A spokesperson for Snap told Forbes they determined the overheating risk was isolated to a “very small number of cases,” but the company opted to recall all of the drones out of a concern for community safety. However, lithium ion batteries used to power larger devices like scooters, e-bikes and mopeds have become a serious problem in cities like New York and London. According to the  , damaged and improperly used lithium batteries are at risk of sparking fires through a process called thermal runway, which quickly turns small fires into uncontrollable blazes. According to FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, lithium ion batteries have caused almost 500 fires in New York City alone in the last three years. A total of 24 people have died in these fires, including   in a Chinatown apartment located above an e-bike shop and charging station in June. At the   earlier this month, Kavanagh spoke about the ongoing threat to the public and firefighters, which she said was caused by “a perfect storm of demand for battery powered devices and a supply of cheap, unregulated products flooding in from overseas to meet this demand.”"

Tuesday’s drop came amid the report from TF International Securities that predicted iPhone shipments will be trimmed down to about 200 million units this year, a 15% decrease year-over-year. The report attributed the figures to a supply chain survey that indicated “Apple lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments” of key semiconductor components—electronic pieces used in devices from phones and computers to vehicles and televisions. TF International Securities also claimed smartphone maker Huawei’s return in the Chinese market, alongside rising popularity of foldable phones, will contribute to the shipment decline. A lack of “significant design changes” with new iPhone models will also harm Apple’s shipping momentum, at least until 2025 at the earliest, the report added.

    "title": "Inside Saudi Arabia’s $800 Billion Tourism Moonshot",
    "content": "hatever your preconceived notion of Saudi Arabia as a travel destination is, it’s about to be get a major renovation. Imagine Sindalah, for example, a   with three ultra-luxe resorts, 38 high-end restaurants and multiple superyacht marinas. Or Qiddiya, a   of 600,000 people rising from the desert floor, dedicated to esports and gaming. How about Trojena, a space-age   built above the high desert? Or The Red Sea, a   of 50 luxury resorts and 8,000 hotel rooms spread across 22 islands in a Maldives-style archipelago—powered entirely by wind and solar energy? Also in the works is The Rig, a   built on an off-shore oil platform. In addition, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a major cruise destination, with   having recently bought a $300-million ship. Across the Kingdom, new roads, airports, golf courses and cruise terminals are rising from the sand. The map is literally being redrawn in real time. Then there are all the new hotels, with their thousands of freshly built rooms. The world’s most iconic hospitality companies—Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, St. Regis, Fairmont, Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and InterContinental—are falling over themselves to jump into a construction pipeline that’s churning faster than anywhere else in the world. Any one of these projects might momentarily pierce the travel industry’s fleeting attention span. But together, what’s going on in Saudi Arabia simply cannot be ignored. Indeed, it can be often difficult to visualize the vastness of Saudi Arabia’s physical transformation. Some of the most notable ongoing projects—including Sindalah, the 7-star private island, and Trojena, the improbable desert ski resort—fall within NEOM, a $500-billion built-from-scratch region in northwest Saudi Arabia where the Kingdom is creating new cities, resorts and other developments. At 10,200 square miles and bounded by the Red Sea to the south and the Gulf of Aqaba to the west, it’s roughly the size of Albania. Fantasy Island: Sindalah will feature 88 villas, 333 apartments, 51 luxury retail stores and an 86-berth superyacht marina. Bankrolled mainly by the Kingdom’s $700-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the idea for NEOM was born out of  , Saudi Arabia’s grand plan to shake off its historic reliance on oil and diversify its economy. One of the scheme’s pillars involves reinventing the country as a global tourism juggernaut. When first announced in 2016, the Kingdom’s tourism goals seemed fanciful: Attract 100 million foreign and domestic visitors to the country every year and grow tourism’s share of the economy from about 3% to 10%. Oh, and do it all in just 14 years. That aspiration seemed all the more preposterous given that, in 2016, Saudi Arabia had not yet opened its doors to international leisure travelers. At the time, travel to the Kingdom was almost entirely restricted to three types of people: expatriate workers, those with business visas, and religious pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Then in 2019,   it would provide e-visas and visas on arrival to visitors from 49 countries, including the United States. Among other changes announced at the time: Female visitors would be exempted from wearing an abaya, the traditional and otherwise obligatory head-to-toe robe, in public places and would be allowed to travel without a male companion. Tourists would still be required to dress modestly and Mecca would remain off-limits to non-Muslims. Since Saudi Arabia opened to the international travel market, the speed and spare-no-expense approach to its transformation has stunned even the most seasoned tourism analysts. “We’re seeing hugely ambitious plans, huge amounts of development,” says Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism research at  . “Billions, ultimately trillions, worth of dollars being invested in infrastructure and in diversifying their economy.” The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated the Kingdom has already spent $800 billion, and that doesn’t include the massive amounts of foreign investments pouring in. The pandemic delayed some projects, of course, but rather than scaling back expectations, the Saudis ratcheted up their goal to 150 million annual visitors by 2030. Here’s where semantics come into play. In tourism parlance, a “visitor” is defined as someone who visits a site within the country, which is very different from what Euromonitor deems an “arrival,” someone who makes an overnight stay. (Other organizations sometimes call the latter “tourists.”) Saudi Arabia had over 24 million foreign arrivals in 2023 and will welcome nearly 37 million in 2030, according to Euromonitor projections. “So if each of those 37 million overnight tourists visits three sites, you pretty much have got your 100 million visits,” Bremner says. “Then add on top of that your domestic tourists, and their own set targets are quite achievable.” A more meaningful measure of success is how much foreigners are expected to spend while in Saudi Arabia. Euromonitor predicts that international tourists will spend $38 billion in 2030. But the total economic impact for Saudi Arabia will be far greater after adding in domestic travelers’ expenditures and the ripple effect of one million new tourism jobs. The WTTC projects that, by 2032, Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector could contribute nearly $169 billion to its GDP, representing 17.1% of the total Saudi economy. Waterworld: The Red Sea Global project features several luxury resorts, including one with overwater bungalows. “Remember, they’re building this destination on the ledger, essentially from scratch, for the international market, and they are bringing in the best of the best in terms of the quality of people they’re working with” says Bremner. “I can see that they’ve thought through every single aspect of tourism, from the staff to the product, the brand, the service, the connectivity, the sustainability. So it really does feel like they’re building something for the next century ahead.” Preparing for the future also means recognizing the seismic shift in what the next generations of global travelers will want. Roughly 90% of young Chinese travelers and 70% of Gen Z travelers in the UK, Australia and India say they are looking to discover new destinations, according to data from  . In that sense, being the new kid on the tourism block is an enormous plus. “New generations have a lot more information through social media,” Billy Canellas, head of asset management at NEOM,   at the Skift Global Forum East in December. “[Younger travelers] are very well educated about the effects of overtourism in traditional destinations,” he added, noting “a clear tendency towards the eco-friendly and sustainable destinations” and an eagerness to learn about a destination’s “culture and the traditions of diversity.” “The luxury market is getting more diverse and younger, and it's shifting to the emerging markets,” says Bremner, noting that the United Arab Emirates, India and China are all highly appealing to this demographic. “We have this fresh-faced luxury traveler, and it's not the traditional older generation of travelers with lots of money. It’s the New World luxury traveler, highly digital, very environmentally conscious, and for whom social impact is important.” “Make no mistake,” says Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, “what Saudi Arabia is doing is they’re identifying who are some of the most important travelers are—the people willing to spend a lot of money on experiences—and asking, How do we go get them?” There are, of course, many ways for the Saudi grand vision to go sideways. First, there are enormous financial risks inherit in tackling so many giga projects all at once, even for a country with bottomless pockets. “The Saudis are running at 82% public debt compared to government revenue,” Bremner says, noting that official public debt as a percentage of GDP was 23.8% in 2023. Still, it’s all relative. The Kingdom’s debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly double what it was a decade ago, but still quite low compared to other countries. For example, Switzerland’s government debt is 41% of GDP. The U.S. and Canadian governments’ debt is 133% and 106% of GDP, respectively. The U.K.’s debt is 98% of GDP. Bremner’s biggest concern is hotel overcapacity, which would ultimately suppress prices. “That luxury positioning is going to come under a little bit of erosion, because [the Saudis] are moving so quickly. With that level of supply, it is quite hard to balance,” she says, adding that Euromonitor International’s latest forecast model predicts that the average traveler’s spend will have already dropped by 2030. “Too many hotel rooms that aren’t being filled will drive prices down, so that’s a risk.” Sand Dollars: A new Four Seasons is a part of Red Sea Global and will have 149 rooms and suites, a spa and an 18-hole golf course. In addition, Saudi Arabia has a persistent PR problem among many would-be travelers, especially those from the West. The Kingdom still has strict laws about drinking and severe restrictions for women, not to mention allegations of human rights abuses and attacks against journalists. In 2021, the U.S.   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of   journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But any concerns about human rights haven’t stopped multinational corporations from investing in the Kingdom’s grand vision. “For some players, it will be a very important issue, perhaps a complete barrier to entry,” says Bremner. “However, we can see that the majority of luxury hotel brands have already shifted from China and the U.A.E. into Saudi Arabia.” After all, the international travel market loves nothing more than a shiny, new destination in an emerging market and right now, the Middle East is having a moment. “You have the Middle East in the sort of perfect location,” says Bremner, “just like Turkey—within a five-hour flight of Asia and of Western Europe.” Even with the start of the Israel-Hamas War last October, the Mideast was nevertheless the fastest-growing tourism region in 2023, with international arrivals 23% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the  . That’s 35% above the global average, as the rest of the world’s tourism is, on average, still at a 12 point deficit compared to 2019 visitor volume. While just over three million American tourists visited the region in 2023—making up 12.6% of total outbound U.S. tourists—that’s a massive 39% jump from 2019. And though the Middle East’s portion of American tourists was smaller than those of Europe (40%) and Asia (15.7%) last year, it was the only one of the three regions that has grown since the pandemic, according to data from National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO), the agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks tourism statistics. But Freeman isn’t concerned about Saudi Arabia’s ability to lure large numbers of American tourists. “I'm worried about them trying to attract Europeans, high-spending Middle Easterners, and Asians, who might have otherwise come and spent their money in the United States,” he says. After all, Freeman says, international tourism is an increasingly competitive sport where one country’s gain is another’s loss: “What gives us pause,” he says, “is that other nations now realize that travel is a global competition to figure out who can attract the customer.”"

    "title": "Exposing The Myth Of Decentralization",
    "content": "holders of a cryptocurrency called the   were told they were being cashed out of their investments, like it or not. The tokens were issued by the Aragon Association, a Zug, Switzerland-based non-profit entity that writes software that helps run 7,500 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) managing a staggering $25 billion in crypto assets. Aragon also started a DAO of its own with the lofty if quixotic goal of creating a court system to settle disputes in the online world, and holders of ANT, as the token is known, would be eligible to be the jurors. The concept caught the eye of crypto-friendly venture-capitalist Tim Draper, whose Draper Associates bought $1 million worth of the tokens in February 2020 but has since cashed out. Tim Draper said on   at the time that this “new form of governing from Aragon” was “very exciting.” It still may be, but the   holders are not going to be part of it. They’re getting kicked to the curb as the Aragon Association, a standard-bearer for decentralized finance, did a very centralized thing: it unilaterally decided to put its assets beyond the reach of corporate activists. A group that included hedge fund Arca Investments wanted to close the gap between the approximately $200 million that Aragon had in assets in early May and the $123 million market value of ANT, trading at just over $3 a token at the time and $2 just two months prior. Arca did not respond to a request for comment sent via its website. Fearing investors could eventually control more than 50% of the votes, the association offered a take-it-or-leave it buyout of 0.0025376 ether, about $5.76, and holders have 12 months–until November of this year–to cash in. The deal will see at least $11 million and possibly much more go to a successor not-for-profit company set up by Aragon. The Aragon Association did not respond to requests for comment. There may yet be more to the story. Disgruntled ANT holders managed to get hold of $300,000 in the DAO and have used it to retain a law firm to potentially oppose Aragon’s strategy. ‘Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself.’\n\n If all of this seems like the height of 1980 corporate raider culture on Wall Street, that’s because it is. Aragon’s story illustrates that decentralization of finance and governance, where decisions are made by large numbers of individuals instead of a handful of large organizations, might be nothing more than a utopian pipe dream. Decentralization is “what you have to do if you are in crypto to attract new investors and get more legitimacy,” says Camila Russo, founder of decentralized finance-focused publication The Defiant. Much of the cryptocurrency business just mimics what already exists in traditional finance but with an alluring high-tech narrative.  the Aragon Association was meant to be a “token-governed digital jurisdiction,” according to its  , a kind of constitution for crypto projects. It aimed to create a “decentralized court” to manage user conflicts beyond what is programmable into smart contracts, the self-executing agreements that are the basis for decentralized finance. Clients for its management software included  , the dominant crypto-staking service, and metaverse provider  . The association raised $25 million through the sale of the ANT token in May 2017, followed by a   that declared it would create free, open-source technology to allow the management of DAOs as part of its “fight for freedom.” But it wasn’t until January 2023 that the Aragon DAO was launched, with the intention that it become the organization’s governing body and keeper of its funds–including the proceeds of the ANT sale, which still were held by the association. Throughout that year, the goal was to slowly move the assets to the DAO, says a source familiar with the inner workings of the organization. “There was pressure both internally and externally to be a DAO building technology for DAOs.” Ironically, the provider of voting technology for decentralized organizations found that complete decentralization was not necessarily efficient. “We’re so fixated on this one avenue of trying to decentralize,” says Anthony Leutenegger,  , a new company made up of the DAO’s development team. “Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself.” Leutenegger says Aragon X will be restructuring into a traditional Switzerland-based not-for-profit company in November when the redemption period for the ANT tokens ends. He said his team was not part of the Aragon Association board and could not address the legalities of the DAO dissolution. The company’s rationale for forcing out the ANT holders was that Swiss law required it. Describing the activists as “a coordinated group,” the association said in a May 9  , “Evidence indicates that their involvement is aimed at extracting value from Aragon for financial profit. The Aragon treasury was established with the explicit mission of supporting builders to advance decentralized governance infrastructure.” The intention was to make ANT a utility token under Swiss regulations, with the stated purpose of “providing holders of the token permissionless, trustless, and censorship-resistant decentralized governance participation in working towards the mission of the Aragon project.” Turn the social mission into a profit-making enterprise, Aragon contends, and that could “result in regulatory enforcement actions.” For its part, Arca said in an   that while Aragon’s goals are “ambitious and noble” that “in order to unlock future utility and governance value, there must be recognition of the financial value or risk dissolution.” It proposed Aragon buy ANT tokens to drive up their price, similar to a stock repurchase in the equity market. Arca ended up getting the buyback it sought but found the terms “bittersweet.” The deal provides $11 million to fund a new not-for-profit that will take over the DAO’s intended position, but if any ANT is not tendered by November, it becomes worthless and Aragon keeps the funds. Arca reckoned in a November   on its website that 25-35 percent of the outstanding tokens would not be redeemed, leaving $43.5 million to $61.4 million of assets for the new company. Over half of the ANT tokens, about 17.4 million, had been handed in so far, according to data from  . The dustup with Arca came just after the Aragon Association transferred the first funds to the Aragon DAO, totaling $300,000. Remaining ANT holders opted to engage Patagon Management, an investment firm with a track record of litigating against DAO founding teams and grant it the $300,000, with an eye to undertaking negotiations with or legal action against Aragon. ANT tokens taken from the DAO were “being taken at the direct expense of investors with no legal basis,” Patagon, which did not respond to requests for comment,  . “It is in our opinion papered over, beautified theft.”  been the driving philosophy for thousands of entrepreneurs and developers since the introduction of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto, its mysterious creator whose identity is  ,   a peer-to-peer payment system that would rely on cryptographic proofs to validate transactions, replacing intermediaries like banks and brokers. That concept gave rise to an entire industry, with cryptocurrencies now worth almost $1.7 trillion, that relies on distributed ledgers to exchange, trace and establish ownership of assets including everything from physical assets like precious metals and real estate to digital money itself. Companies like JPMorgan, Samsung and Tencent use the underlying   in supply-chain management, data security and digital-identity verification. As recently as 2021 and 2022, at the peak of crypto’s latest bull run, venture-capital investors poured nearly $50 billion into the blockchain-based economy, according to PitchBook. How did these companies end up with more liabilities or debt than they could handle in the first place? The simple answer is they offered enticingly high yields.\n “Parties agreeing to conduct transactions openly and transparently on the blockchain, as opposed to backroom deals by opaque, human, potentially-conflicted financial actors, is the vision we should be striving for, rather than clinging on to inefficient centralized financial systems,” wrote Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of blockchain-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, in a  , contending that decentralized finance, or DeFi, offered better protections to investors than centrally managed companies. At about the same time, however, crypto brokerage Voyager and digital-loan company Celsius, filed for bankruptcy amid the collapse in cryptocurrency prices that disrupted their business models. Morehead considers the failures to be a strength of DeFi–in the case of Celsius, for example, the business was forced by smart contracts to pay down loans to lenders to preserve collateral–but an opposing view would be that inflexible automated agreements that do not allow for changing conditions are no way to run an industry. How did these companies end up with more liabilities or debt than they could handle in the first place? The simple answer is they offered enticingly high yields. At the time when banks and their newfangled neobank rivals offered 4-5% rates on high-yield savings accounts, DeFi lenders paid  . But a series of hacks and crises in both DeFi and the broader industry, culminating in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX in November 2023, rattled investors. The amount of cryptocurrencies held in DeFi projects now rests at $54.7 billion—below that of a mid-sized regional bank—compared with a peak of about $179 billion in November 2021, according to data aggregator DeFi Llama. While the decline can be mainly ascribed to the drop in cryptocurrency prices, it also is the true that increased interest rates on low-risk assets such as Treasuries as governments withdraw pandemic-related support to their markets are diminishing the appeal of DeFi. A bigger issue is that the decentralization concept seems better in theory than practice. One reason is that blockchain projects can be hijacked if a single entity or a group of allies controls more than half of the computing power or rights to validate network transactions. In this scenario, known as a 51 percent attack, bad actors could prevent new transactions or reverse settled ones, or they could send the same tokens to multiple recipients, which potentially would be fatal to the entire blockchain. Aragon suggested that something similar occurred when it transferred its first batch of ANT tokens to its DAO, saying in its May 9 blog post that it had suffered a “coordinated social engineering and 51% attack.” This is not exactly the same as such an attack on a blockchain because DAOs are meant to be governed by their token holders, but Aragon’s decision to take matters into its own hands to satisfy what it sees as legal requirements shows how real-world concerns can limit pure decentralization. “​​Full decentralization in DeFi is illusory,” wrote economists at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in a   of the industry. “DeFi platforms have an element of centralization, which typically revolves around holders of ‘governance tokens’ (often platform developers) who vote on proposals, not unlike corporate shareholders.” Decisions on major DeFi projects typically do not pass without support from their founders and financial backers, Andre Cronje, founder of Yearn.Finance, a yield farming robo-advisor, told   in 2022. “As much as there is talk of decentralization, unless it is back-channeled there will be no approval.” That year, researchers from the University of Luxembourg did   on tokenized voting at nine big DeFi projects and discovered that rights “are highly concentrated,” and their exercise “is very low.” Unlike voting for common stocks, there is no mandate to notify token holders of upcoming votes, and for those who store their DeFi tokens on exchanges like Coinbase there isn’t even a mechanism to allow voting. “DeFi has evolved in a much more centralized way than expected,” says The Defiant’s Russo. “You see this centralization in governance (usually a small team making most of the decisions), in the distribution of token ownership—most tokens are owned by teams and a few VCs. Then there's kind of a technical centralization, like the presence of backdoors in smart contracts.” But “this theater of decentralization is not necessary,” she adds. “I think everyone can understand that there's a progression towards this decentralization ideal” and that “you can’t be fully decentralized from the start. I would just push for all of these protocols to be more upfront about their degree of centralization. There’s a way to grow in a more transparent way.”  are adding to DeFi’s woes. In June, a U.S. judge granted a default judgment in favor of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against the decentralized collective Ooki DAO, ruling that it was a “person” under the law and was therefore liable for illegally operating a trading platform and unlawfully acting as a futures dealer. The organization was ordered to pay $643,542 and shut itself down. “The founders created the Ooki DAO with an evasive purpose and with the explicit goal of operating an illegal trading platform without legal accountability,”   Ian McGinley, the CFTC’s enforcement director. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.” None of the DAO members have responded to the summons nor appeared in court, and the founders of predecessor organization bZeroX–identified in a   as Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner–have not responded to a request for comment. Multiple friend-of-the-court briefs filed on Ooki's behalf argued that DAOs should not be treated as a singular entity. “The reason why the amicus effort was so important is that if a DAO member steps up and says ‘Hey, I'm a member of the DAO, I want to defend this,’ they're putting themselves in the crosshairs,” says Gabriel Shapiro, a lawyer who was involved in filing one of the briefs in support of Ooki. More importantly, he adds, “100% of DeFi would be illegal under CFTC’s reasoning. Why? Well, pretty much all of DeFi involves margin, financing or leverage.” Beyond DAOs, authorities have also gone after open-source software like crypto mixer Tornado Cash, which enables users to conceal digital transactions. In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)   the service, claiming that it had been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019, including $455 million allegedly stolen by North Korean hackers. A few days later, Dutch authorities arrested one of the alleged founders of Tornado, Alexey Pertsev, on money laundering charges. He remains in the Netherlands, where his trial is scheduled for March. The following year, U.S. prosecutors charged two more Tornado developers, Roman Semenov and Roman Storm. While Semenov is at large and believed to be in Dubai,   blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, Storm is under house arrest at his Washington home, Coindesk has  . His trial is set for September. On January 22, Storm   a video on X in which he asked for donations that would help fund his and Pertsev’s defense. “My legal team and I are going to put forth a strong defense at trial, not just for my family's sake, but for the future software developers and financial privacy,” said Storm. The campaign titled “Open Source Is Not A Crime” has already raised  . Storm and Semenov have not responded to requests for comment. Here too, the industry pushed back. “OFAC’s action sets a dangerous new precedent that drastically exceeds their authority and jeopardizes law-abiding Americans’ right to privacy,” said Marisa Coppel, senior counsel at the non-profit Blockchain Association, in a   accompanying the organization’s second amicus brief in support of Tornado Cash. “OFAC must see Tornado Cash for what it is: a tool that can be used by anyone. Rather than sanctioning a tool with a lawful purpose, OFAC should remain focused on the bad actors that misuse such tools.”  setbacks and regulatory pushback, decentralized systems remain popular in the cryptocurrency world. Decentralization has been more of “a means to an end—what can you do as a developer building on these new platforms that you couldn’t have done before?” asks  , cofounder of blockchain governance platform Llama. After all, “the only way to arrive at the best organizational structures is to try a lot of different things and see what works and what doesn’t.” , cofounder of Syndicate, an infrastructure provider for blockchain-based internet products, says, “Looking at it over a very long-term timescale, the decentralized tech will always be less efficient and less usable than its centralized counterparts. At the end of the day, storing data on one system that is trusted, like the database, will always be more efficient than storing data on 10,000 nodes that are widely distributed. “But if we harness the benefits of this, we will get to the point where I think the downsides become less noticeable and the upsides become much more present. ​​If we do encode certain guarantees, like the ability to not change fees overnight, then we've created a better world.”"

    "title": "Biden Wins South Carolina Primary",
    "content": "President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary in South Carolina, a state that carried his path to the nomination in the 2020 presidential election—as his campaign hopes Saturday’s victory will re-energize Black voters who have strayed from the president, contributing to his sliding approval rating. President Joe Biden speaks at the Biden for President 2024 campaign headquarters Saturday in  The Associated Press called the race for Biden at 7:23 p.m.—just 23 minutes after the polls closed Saturday—with Biden having more than 95% support. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson each had less than 2% of the vote. Biden was widely expected to win the South Carolina primary and is the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. South Carolina kicked off the Democratic nominating contest after the Democratic National Committee moved the state ahead of New Hampshire and Iowa on the official primary calendar—a symbolic reward to its Democratic voters who delivered Biden a resounding victory in the state in the 2020 presidential nomination, when all 46 counties voted for him. South Carolina, where early voting kicked off Jan. 22, will award 55 delegates of the 1,991 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. “The truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact,” Biden told an audience at an event in Columbia, South Carolina last month. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.” 19. That’s the number of percentage points Biden’s support among Black voters declined last year, according to a November NBC   that found his approval rating had dipped to 40% among all voters, the lowest level of his presidency. It currently stands at 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s   The Biden campaign hopes his win in South Carolina, where about 60% of Democratic voters are Black, will mobilize the key demographic in subsequent primaries and the general election. Biden is likely to face former President Donald Trump in a historic rematch in the November general election as Trump appears poised to clinch the Republican nomination after winning both the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. Biden has ratcheted up his attacks on Trump since he officially began campaigning at the start of the year, centering his talking points around contrasting himself with the former president, rather than highlighting his own record. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, repeatedly called him a “loser” over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and regularly reminds voters Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump and his Republican allies, meanwhile, accuse Biden of corruption, alleging he has improperly meddled in his son Hunter Biden and other family members’ business dealings. Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail largely surrounds his own four criminal indictments and accusing the prosecutors, without evidence, of bringing the cases in an effort to boost Biden’s reelection chances. Their rematch is expected to be a close contest, as polls show Trump leads Biden by less than two points, according to Real Clear Politics’  The next Democratic primary is Thursday in Nevada. Republicans will hold their primary the same day. No delegates will be awarded in the GOP contest and instead will go to the winner of the caucuses on Feb. 8 thanks to a new law that effectively split the state’s primary and caucuses into two separate events on different days. Trump is running in the caucuses, while former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is running in the primary. New Hampshire held its Democratic primary on Jan. 23, but the contest was unsanctioned and no delegates were awarded following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties. In protest of the new calendar, state Democrats opted to hold the primary on the same day as the GOP. Biden sided with the Democratic National Committee and did not appear on the ballot, but beat Phillips and Williamson anyway, winning 64% of votes following a successful write-in campaign."

    "content": "Microsoft crossed a $3 trillion market capitalization for the first time in its history Wednesday,   the long-time tech leader’s massive artificial intelligence win. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has led his company to a record market value amid the AI boom. Shares of Microsoft rallied in morning trading as much as 1.5% to $404.72, their highest price ever. That sent Microsoft’s market cap to $3.004 trillion. Apple, which became the only firm to ever score a $3 trillion valuation last summer, remains slightly more valuable than Microsoft, with a $3.03 trillion market cap Wednesday. The $3 trillion milestone caps a dramatic rise for Microsoft coinciding with a broad technology rally and its backing of OpenAI, producer of the hit generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. Since ChatGPT’s November 2022 release, shares of Microsoft are up more than 60%, beating the S&P 500’s roughly 20% rise and the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s nearly 40% jump during the period, also topping Apple stock’s roughly 30% gain during the timeframe. Microsoft became one of the few major firms to translate intensifying AI interest into tangibly better financial results, as the firm has posted   revenues in each of its last two fiscal quarters, buoyed by 20% year-over-year growth in its AI-heavy intelligent cloud division. Wednesday’s gains came during a broad tech rally on the back of Netflix’s strong earnings report, as the Nasdaq rose almost 1%. Microsoft   a $1 billion market cap in 1986, its first year as a public company. The firm briefly overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world earlier this month. Microsoft and Apple are among the “magnificent seven” big tech stocks driving much of the stock market’s recovery dating back to 2022, joined by Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. All seven of those companies have benefited from investors’ desire for exposure to AI, though only four (Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia) have risen to all-time highs. Microsoft “continues to dominate market share within the AI transformation taking place despite increased competition,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an October note to clients. Microsoft will report quarterly earnings next Thursday. Analysts project the company to report $61 billion in sales, according to FactSet, which would be another all-time high. Another big-tech company notched a major market cap milestone Wednesday: Meta. The Facebook parent company registered a $1 trillion valuation for the first time since 2021."

    "content": "Pending legal cases against Former President Donald Trump are expected to come to a head this year, as the ex-president faces the possibility of four criminal trials alongside multiple civil cases—though the ex-president’s federal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election has already been delayed, and it’s unclear how many cases will go to trial before voters go to the polls. Former President Donald Trump gestures as he wraps up a campaign event on December 19 in Waterloo,  Trump’s January was already filled with a number of court appearances, as closing arguments took place in the   against him and his company, and he went to trial against writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against him—resulting in a jury   Trump to pay her $83.3 million. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear   in Trump’s challenge of a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that disqualified him from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, which stands to have ramifications nationwide as voters in numerous other states also try to kick Trump off the ballot. Trump was scheduled to go to trial in the   against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, brought by special counsel Jack Smith—but the case has gotten delayed waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges, and it was   from the court’s calendar, with presiding Judge Tanya Chutkan now scheduled to oversee other trials starting on March 18 and April 2. Trial is scheduled to start in the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal case against Trump in state court, which   him of falsifying business records in conjunction with “hush-money” payments made to women during his 2016 campaign—and is so far expected to proceed as scheduled. Trump is slated to go to trial in the federal   against him for allegedly mishandling White House documents that he brought back to Mar-A-Lago, though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March, and the judge has already   several deadlines, which likely makes it harder for the trial to proceed on time. Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney Fani Willis has   this as the trial start date in her   against Trump and his allies for trying to overturn the 2020 election—but it’s unclear whether it actually will be, as no final trial dates have yet been set. The cases against Trump carry the possibility of significant penalties against the former president, including prison time. Trump could be sentenced to up to   in prison if he were convicted of every criminal count against him and given the maximum punishment, though that’s unlikely to happen. He could also be fined up to   in the criminal cases against him, plus whatever damages he’s ordered to pay in civil cases. The ex-president also faces more legal challenges in which a trial date hasn’t been set yet, with civil lawsuits   from Capitol police officers and Democratic lawmakers that seek to hold Trump liable for Jan. 6 and lawsuits still pending across the country that challenge Trump’s candidacy under the 14th Amendment. How the pending cases will affect the 2024 election. It’s still hard to say how the Supreme Court could rule on the 14th Amendment issue—and whether their ruling would only affect Colorado or other states—and it’s still hard to predict how many of Trump’s criminal cases will be decided before either the presidential primary wraps up this summer or the November general election. The federal election case can only move forward once the federal appeals court rules on Trump’s motion to dismiss the charges—though once it does, the trial is expected to be further delayed by Trump appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court. Trump has tried to delay the trials against him until after the 2024 election, particularly given that in the federal cases against him, getting reelected would mean he could appoint prosecutors willing to drop the charges against him. Even if Trump does get convicted before the election, it still wouldn’t necessarily thwart his chances of becoming president, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from being in the White House—though recent   suggests swing voters could be dissuaded from voting for him. Trump has strongly denied the charges and civil allegations against him, pleading not guilty to the criminal charges against him and declaring cases against him to be a “witch hunt” designed to harm his presidential candidacy. The ex-president has also continued to push false claims of election fraud despite facing repercussions for trying to overturn the 2020 election,   on Truth Social in January he “did nothing wrong” and was “bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without question, Rigged and Stolen.” 56%. That’s the share of U.S. adults who believe Trump is “probably guilty” of a criminal conspiracy stemming from his false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, according to a Washington Post/University of Maryland   released in January. That includes 88% of Democrats but only 18% of Republicans. A smaller 46% believe Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 attack should disqualify him from the presidency, as the 14th Amendment cases against him argue. Trump faces 91 total criminal charges in the four criminal cases against him, which were all brought in 2023 as yearslong investigations into the ex-president wrapped up and ended with indictments. Trump’s pending legal cases come after the ex-president already began to face legal consequences in 2023, including being found liable for defaming and   Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. Though he hasn’t issued his final verdict yet in Trump’s civil fraud trial, New York Judge Arthur Engoron also ruled ahead of the trial that Trump and his co-defendants—including his sons—are   because they misstating the value of their assets on financial documents, which the state alleges was done to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. Engoron ordered Trump’s business certificates to be canceled as part of that ruling, though an appeals court has put that on hold while the order gets appealed.

    "content": "A much-anticipated crackdown on the southern border that both many Republicans and President Joe Biden support—and which Senate backers say could be voted on this week—might fail just because Donald Trump wants it to, and is pressing his supporters to vote against it. Trump’s campaign of pressure to senators and public criticism at rallies and on social media may  At a   on Saturday night, the former president continued his campaign to scuttle the deal, which he called a “monstrosity,” saying “there is zero chance I will support this horrible open border betrayal of America,” Trump told supporters on Saturday night, without clearly describing his opposition to the bill. Trump has made his ability to solve the border crisis his primary campaign message, and his only clear criticism of the bipartisan plan is that the border deal would also mean “billions of dollars to Ukraine and other countries.” Biden and House Republicans have been in a standoff for months: Biden has sought resuming support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia, while Republicans have withheld that funding until Biden commits to solving the surge in migration at the border. But Trump appears to not want Biden to notch any success—and his pressure campaign appears to be working: House Speaker Mike Johnson called any bipartisan Senate bill “likely dead on arrival” on Friday, instead   to Republican colleagues that he would continue to support the GOP’s “Secure the Border Act” which failed to get any Democratic support when it was introduced in May. In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) privately said he would still support the Biden-backed bill, while admitting Trump’s criticism has put Republicans in a challenging position,   reported. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the lead negotiators, told   on Sunday they were “finalizing the last pieces of text right now” and preparing to present the bill on the floor as early as next week. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), called Trump’s actions “appalling,”   that “he does not want us to solve the problem at the border, he wants us to lay the blame of the border at Biden—and the idea that someone running for president would say ‘please hurt the country so I can blame my opponent and help my politics’ is a shocking moment.” “I notice a lot of the Senators… they’re blaming it on me,” Trump said at his   on Saturday. “I said ‘that’s ok, please blame it on me, please.’” 2.4 million. That’s the number of total migrant encounters recorded at the southern border by Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, according to Republicans on the House  . At his rally on Saturday, Trump claimed “two million illegals crossed the border every single year in the past, and now that number’s changing to maybe eight times that amount,” but the data presented by the committee states that agents only encountered about 3.2 million total migrants across the country last year. On Sunday morning, House Republicans unveiled the text of two new   against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which they plan to introduce to the House Homeland Security Committee next week. Mayorkas has faced   from congressional Republicans for his handling of the border, and faced two impeachment hearings earlier this month. The newly released articles accuse Mayorkas of violating his oath of office by “willfully refus[ing] to comply with numerous detention requirements spelled out by the Immigration and Nationality Act.” The White House has maintained that there is no compelling case against Mayorkas. The DHS also circulated a   criticizing the articles of impeachment, accusing Republicans of “ignor[ing] the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas.” The articles are expected to vote along party lines and advance the articles to a full House vote on Tuesday,   reported. In a rare move on Friday, President Biden   of the bipartisan deal to pass sweeping immigration reform measures, allowing the Department of Homeland Security to close the southern border after they encounter a daily average of more than 4,000 migrants over the course of a week. The bill also provides funding for thousands of more border patrol agents, asylum officers and immigration judges to handle the ongoing surge, as well as 100 “cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl,” according to the White House. However, many specific details of the bill have not yet been released, including any amount of aid promised for Ukraine should the bill pass. Biden has called thebill a “win for America.”"

The Department of Justice is asking the court to intervene, noting that the state’s actions since the government filing “demonstrate an escalation of the state’s measures to block” Border Patrol duties. In a   on X, formerly Twitter, Abbott reposted a video of Shelby Park, writing that “as caravans of migrants are moving through Mexico toward the border, we are making clear that Texas will be a tough place to cross.” In its Friday filing, the Department of Justice cites a Dec. 19   from a U.S. Appeals Court that bars Border Patrol agents from destroying state-erected fencing—a decision that the Justice Department is currently appealing—from contributing to the lack of access to the area. The Justice Department has also  Texas over a controversial immigration law that gives state officials the authority to arrest migrants crossing the border illegally—enforcement that’s typically reserved for the federal government. As the number of migrants crossing the border continues to surge, Abbott and other Texas Republicans have criticized the Biden Administration’s response. Eagle Pass has been the focus of these debates in recent months,  to the Texas Tribune, which notes that in June, Salinas agreed to allow the state to declare Shelby Park private property so that state officials could arrest migrants for trespassing. But resident complaints prompted Salinas to support rescinding that decision. There have been conflicting messages on the impact of the seizure on Border Patrol operations. The Border Patrol Union—which has   the Biden Administration’s response to the border—  that the state’s actions would enhance Border Patrol operations by taking agents away from an area where many migrants “are simply surrendering” and allowing them to patrol areas with higher numbers of migrants “who attempt to escape arrest.” But in the Department of Justice court filing, Border Patrol Lead Field Coordinator Robert Danley testified that Border Patrol uses the now fenced-off area as a “pre-staging area” for migrant encounters, where Border Patrol engages in mobile intake of migrants and treats emergent medical or welfare needs. Because of Texas’ actions, “Border Patrol is being denied the opportunity to use the area for staging migrants in a safe location that allows for the optimal use of law enforcement resources.” 2.4 million. That’s how many times migrants were caught  , a number that the government says is the highest since at least 1960. Abbott was the target of backlash after comments he made in a radio interview last week resurfaced, where he   that Texas was doing everything it’s power to stop immigration, noting: “The only thing that we're not doing is we're not shooting people who come across the border, because of course, the Biden administration would charge us with murder.” State Democrats quickly denounced the comments as they came to light."

    "title": "These Women Are Selling Mary Kay Makeup From Bomb Shelters In War Torn Ukraine",
    "content": "Marichka Lukyanova has been selling Mary Kay cosmetics during the Ukraine-Russia war. n the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Marichka Lukyanova was inundated with messages from family and friends checking in to make sure she and her two children were safe from the air strikes in Lviv, where she lives. They were safe, luckily, but Lukyanova feared that her business selling Mary Kay cosmetics would be one of the casualties of war. “I said to myself, Marichika, who will need your cosmetics if there is a war in your country?” recalled Lukyanova. But one message surprised Lukyanova: Even in those early weeks of the war, one of her clients wanted to buy more Mary Kay facial cream before she ran out. “She did not want to age, even if rockets were flying overhead.” American multi-level marketing company Mary Kay has shown surprising staying power during the war, with a growing Ukrainian salesforce of an   70,000 women hawking its makeup, even if it means navigating frequent air siren alarms, shelling and blackouts. According to interviews with 16 people selling Mary Kay products on the ground, the cosmetics have become a lifeline for some looking to support their families or make extra money as Ukraine’s economy has suffered from the war. “For many, it is the only source of income. Many now have husbands, brothers or children fighting,” said Elena Krivchenkova, 58, who has been selling Mary Kay products since the 90s when the company first launched in Ukraine. “It is a way to distract themselves from the horror of what is happening.” But it’s been tough going, and the salespeople have been faced with a war-torn economy and double-digit inflation — skincare and cosmetics sales in Ukraine fell 13% to $189 million last year, according to GlobalData — along with the challenges inherent in Mary Kay’s business model. Like other multi-level marketing companies, Mary Kay relies on individual people not just to sell its products to their relatives, friends or others in their social circle, but to recruit them to sell the products, too. There is often an intense pressure to recruit because of the pay model: Consultants, as Mary Kay calls them, make more money when they recruit new people, and their recruits recruit new people. Most people make little or no money working for a multi-level marketing company, warns the Federal Trade Commission. \"They are not helping,” said Robert FitzPatrick, a critic of multi-level marketing companies who has researched the industry for more than two decades. He noted that these types of companies can prey on people who are desperate, “selling themselves as the last best hope” but not delivering, he added. Mary Kay itself has suffered from skepticism about its business model: Sales worldwide fell to $2.5 billion in 2022, down from $3.6 billion five years earlier, according to Forbes’   of America’s largest private companies. “We converted the shelter into a beauty salon.” \n “Like the rest of the world, we continue to actively monitor the situation in Ukraine,” said Mary Kay spokesperson Crayton Webb. “Our leadership in Ukraine is actively engaging with employees and the independent sales force, doing everything they can to ensure their safety and supporting the viability of the business.” Dallas-based Mary Kay, famous for giving out pink Cadillacs to its top salespeople, arrived in Ukraine three decades ago, where it found a burgeoning workforce of women eager for income. While it has a strong presence there, Russia remains an even bigger market — its fifth largest — with 180,000 consultants. But unlike major brands like Starbucks and McDonald’s and other prominent multi-level marketing companies like Herbalife and Amway that closed up shop in the country after the invasion, Mary Kay still operates there. It has had to traverse a tangle of sanctions by staying. “We have many Independent Beauty Consultants in Russia who also rely on Mary Kay, in many cases, for their livelihood. Again, we remain committed to our mission,” Webb said, adding the company ensures “complete adherence to all laws and sanctions.” Most of the Ukrainian consultants that   spoke to say they oppose Mary Kay’s decision to remain in Russia, but seem resigned to it. “I try not to dwell on it because I cannot influence it,” said Krivchenkova. “In Russia, there are many women who have survived only thanks to their Mary Kay business. They did not want this war.” The company’s operations ground to a halt in Ukraine after the war started because of the intense bombing in Kyiv, where Mary Kay’s main warehouse is located. In those first few months of war, consultants resorted to selling whatever products they had on hand to support themselves and their families. Some consultants have hosted charity beauty marathons where a portion of sales are donated to the war effort. Tatiana Korniychuk, 50, began hauling her Mary Kay products into the bomb shelter during air alerts, letting women try new cosmetics while they waited for the time to pass. “We converted the shelter into a beauty salon,” said Korniychuk, who lives in Zhytomyr. Maryna Chaikivska, 29, sold tubes of eye cream, cleanser and charcoal face masks she had stocked in her office after the war broke out. She said that netted her about $1,000 a month, paying the bills for six months. Her husband had lost his job at a pharmaceutical company after bombing in Kharkiv severely curtailed production capacity and was heading to the frontlines to put his medical degree to use treating injured soldiers. “Mary Kay brought colors to a difficult period of life.”\n “There was no other way out,” said Chaikivska, who continued to pitch Springtime skincare regimens and bottled-up concoctions that could help combat stress-induced breakouts and wrinkles to her 1,500 Instagram followers. Maryna Chaikivska. Chaikivska, who lives in Lviv, used to keep some $15,000 worth of inventory on hand, but now she worries about something happening to it. She heard about another consultant who lost all her inventory after her house was hit by explosions and went up in flames. Now she keeps a third of that amount of inventory on hand. Three months into the war, Mary Kay began delivering the cosmetics it had in its partially destroyed Kyiv warehouse. By late 2022, it was slowly beginning to ship new products as its consultants rebuilt their customer bases after millions fled the nation in search of safety. More than   Ukrainians remain outside the country’s borders. (Mary Kay’s Webb says the company shipped products “as soon as possible.”) That’s had a dramatic impact on businesses built on top of the multi-level marketing company. Because so many customers and consultants have left Ukraine, Elena Krivchenkova said that the incomes on her 2,000-person team have fallen by an average of 30% during the war. Consultants have also been impacted by rolling blackouts, which make it difficult to get online to pitch products. Six months into the war, Natalia Sokratova, a 35-year-old former teacher, bought a generator so she could continue posting to Instagram, hosting online tutorials and checking in with her team. Others have bought SIM cards from different wireless providers, so that if one provider struggles to provide Wi-Fi they can try another provider. Some have struggled to make much money from selling Mary Kay cosmetics. Natalia Marynets, a trained lawyer who began selling in 2023, spends two or three hours a day on Mary Kay and has recruited 16 consultants, but still only makes about $200 a month. Mary Kay did not respond to questions about how much the average consultant makes in Ukraine. It does not release earnings figures except in Canada, where it says  . For many of the other women   spoke to, the additional income, however incremental, wasn’t the only benefit of working as a Mary Kay consultant during the war. “Mary Kay brought colors to a difficult period of life,” said Olga Boysyan, a former pharmacist who joined the company last year. She told   selling cosmetics is a welcome distraction when she’s waiting to hear from her husband and son, who are serving in the army. “I have an opportunity to distract our women from negativity and at the same time give them a good mood,” Marynets said. “Even during the Second World War, red lipstick was like an antidepressant for women.”"

    "content": "South Korea is betting on the appeal of K-Pop culture to attract digital nomads. outh Korea has announced that it will launch a new visa specifically for enthusiasts of South Korean culture. The Hallyu visa, also being called the “K-culture training visa,” will allow non-Koreans who register at local performing arts academies to stay in the country for up to two years. Hallyu, which translates to “Korean Wave,” refers to the enormous global popularity of South Korea’s cultural economy exporting K-pop culture through music, films and other artistic mediums. Additionally, the country plans to launch the “K Tourism Road Show” in countries such as the US and Sweden this year. Specific requirements for the K-culture visa have not yet been disclosed, but details are expected by the second half of 2024. Consider that the $10-billion K-pop industry has become so crucial to South Korea’s economy that the country’s GDP   last year after the musical juggernaut BTS announced it would be taking a temporary break while its members explored solo careers. Meanwhile, after being decimated during the Covid-19 pandemic, South Korea’s tourism industry is rebounding as a significant economic driver. A recent report from the World Travel & Tourism Council estimates that the country’s tourism sector will grow at an average rate of 4.8% annually through 2032, significantly outstripping the projected 1.8% growth rate of the national overall economy. Visit Korea has increasingly featured K-culture in its marketing campaigns, to great success.

An asteroid floats in space. An 890-foot asteroid will pass by Earth on Friday, coming within 1.7 million miles of the planet—around seven times further than the Moon—and traveling at a speed of about 11 miles per second,   to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The plaintiff argued the massive pay package was unfair to shareholders and the company’s board had failed in its fiduciary duty by approving it. In her ruling, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick pointed to Musk’s close ties with the board of directors, which was “tasked with negotiating” the pay package on behalf of Tesla. The ruling means Tesla’s board will have to come up with a new compensation plan for Musk, unless the company chooses to appeal. Musk reacted by lashing out at the state of Delaware,  : “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Companies usually pick Delaware as a state of incorporation, despite operating elsewhere due to its tax benefits and corporate-friendly laws.

    "title": "What Is An ARkStorm? Here’s Why California Officials Have Prepared For A ‘Megastorm’ Scenario.",
    "content": "Despite a forecast for possible “life-threatening” rainfall this weekend, California emergency officials have dispelled rumors suggesting the state soon faces an ARkStorm, a hypothetical “megastorm” scenario that scientists suggest could plausibly hit California in the future with devastating rainfall and flooding. The storm is based on weather patterns from the state’s “Great Flood of 1862.” An ARkStorm—named for an atmospheric river thought of as a 1-in-1,000-year event—was developed as a weather model in 2011 and is based on weather patterns in California between 1861 and 1862, when the state suffered from the “Great Flood of 1862,”   to the U.S. Geological Survey. The ARkStorm event would draw heat and moisture from the Pacific Ocean, which then creates a series of atmospheric rivers—long, narrow bands of atmosphere—that trigger conditions similar to the “ferocity of hurricanes” over several weeks along the West Coast. If such a storm occurred, it would result in a “statewide disaster,” the USGS said, as “extensive flooding is deemed realistic” across all of California’s counties and economic sectors. Scientists would be able to “partially” predict aspects of an ARkStorm days before the storm arrives, though California’s flood protection system isn’t designed for an ARkStorm-like event, which would produce a 500-year streamflow event across most of the state, according to the USGS. A   posted to social media last week suggested California has a 30% chance of experiencing an ARkStorm-like event within the next 30 years, suggesting the state would face the “worst natural disaster in world history.” The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services responded, indicating the video was spreading misinformation and that California residents “have nothing to fear.” The state is expected to face   atmospheric river event this weekend, which the National Weather Service warned could result in “dangerous, even life-threatening impacts.” Scientists aren’t sure whether an ARkStorm or weather pattern similar to the 1862 flood will ever hit California, though the scenario is “plausible,”   to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. California’s historic rainfall and flooding between 1861 and 1862 wasn’t a “freak event,” the USGS said, as there have been at least six similar “megastorms” that have hit the state over the last 1,800 years. $725 billion. That’s the projected cost in damages if an ARkStorm ever hits California, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Of this, about $400 billion is estimated for property damage and $325 billion in losses caused by business interruption. The estimate is based on flooding that would “realistically” disrupt thousands of square miles of urban and agricultural land, subsequently resulting in thousands of landslides and disrupting “lifelines throughout the state for days or weeks.” California officials   that more than 4,000 residents—or about 1% of the state’s population—were killed by flooding between 1861 and 1862. Several areas in the state experienced dozens of inches of rainfall during the event, including the old town of Red Dog, which recorded more than 190 inches of rain between July 1, 1861 and June 30, 1862.

    "title": "Will Trump’s Criminal Charges Hurt Him In The Election? Polling Suggests Yes—But It’s Unclear If Cases Will Go To Trial In Time.",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "title": "Trump Calls Central Bank Digital Currency ‘Very Dangerous’—After Vowing To Prohibit Fed’s ‘Digital Dollar’",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump expressed heavy skepticism about the security of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which he has vowed to block, in an interview released Friday, though he personally owns   in cryptocurrency himself, according to Forbes’ estimate, and hawks a line of NFT trading cards. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after  Trump said a so-called “digital dollar” would be “very dangerous,” claiming it could create a situation where money suddenly disappears from people’s bank accounts, he told Fox News in response to a question about his plans to block the Federal Reserve from formally issuing a digital currency. The statements echo a similar claim Trump made in New Hampshire last month, where he told a crowd he would “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.” While Trump has his own personal investments in digital currency, he was critical of the industry during his presidency, calling it “highly volatile,” though Republicans’ have proposed crypto-friendly regulations and Trump, if re-elected, is likely appoint regulators who would be more aligned with digital asset firms than the Biden administration, which is largely skeptical of the industry. The Federal Reserve has not expressed a definitive stance on digital currency, but has been exploring the possibility amid the explosion of private crypto and concerns that it could morph into an unregulated currency system outside of the federal government’s purview. Trump pivoted to artificial intelligence in responding to the question about digital currency in the interview, calling AI “maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything, because there is no real solution,” he said in a preview of the interview, set to be released in full on Sunday. “The AI as they call it . . . is so scary,” he said, referencing a fake speech he recently saw of himself promoting a product he “never endorsed.” Trump, in his New Hampshire speech, likened the creation of a central bank digital currency to a form of “government tyranny,” warning it would give the federal government the ability to “take your money.” The Biden Administration issued a 2022 executive order that ordered government agencies to develop policy recommendations and a potential framework for regulating digital assets. The process for developing a central bank digital currency could take years, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last year, emphasizing that it has not made a decision on its feasibility and is still assessing the public’s appetite for such a system, which would require approval from Congress and the executive branch, Powell said. In his New Hampshire speech, Trump credited his former opponent, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for warning him of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency. Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa primary and endorsed Trump, is among the names being floated as Trump’s potential running mate pick, as he is all-but-certain to clinch the GOP nomination, potentially as soon as March. Ramaswamy has also said a central bank digital currency would create “a mechanism for the government to be able to wipe out your bank account, wipe out your dollars if you say or do something the government disapproves of” calling it “a threat to liberty in this country.” Eleven countries have established a central bank currency, citing plummeting cash usage, increased accessibility, lower infrastructure costs and improved security. More than 100 countries are currently exploring the option."

    "content": "Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of a 17-year-old serving a life sentence for killing four students at a Michigan high school in 2021, testified Friday that the weapon used in the attack was a gift from both parents, after suggesting earlier that she did not trust her husband to keep the gun away from their son. Both parents face involuntary manslaughter charges after not providing their son—who fatally shot  Jennifer   during cross-examination that while she and her husband James “didn’t just hand him a gun as ‘here you go, son,’” the weapon was intended to be used when they went to the gun range “as a family.” School employees were also not notified that their son owned or had access to a gun because Jennifer “didn’t think it was relevant,” despite a meeting on the morning of the shooting in which school officials indicated they were concerned about their son’s mental health. Jennifer   Thursday she “didn’t feel comfortable” being in charge of the gun, which she and James bought as a Christmas gift, later adding James was responsible for keeping the gun locked away. Though James was “entrusted” to store the gun, Jennifer claimed it was “pretty clear you didn’t trust James with much” because he had issues holding a job or handling his money. Their son also never asked for help with mental health issues, Jennifer said, adding he would sometimes have anxiety after taking tests at school and they believed he was “messing around” when he told his parents he was seeing demons in their home. Both Jennifer and James have pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Closing arguments in Jennifer’s case will be held later on Friday. James is expected to stand trial next month. Jennifer, 45, and James, 47, were arrested months after their son Ethan fatally shot four students and wounded seven others at Oxford High School in 2021. Prosecutors   both parents failed to prevent access to the 9mm Sig Sauer handgun used in the attack, suggesting the gun was left unsecured in a drawer in the parents’ bedroom. On the morning of the shooting, the school called both parents after a teacher found a note on Ethan’s desk that said, “the thoughts won’t stop, help me,” with drawings of a handgun nearby.   from Ethan’s journals also indicated his “parents won’t listen to me about help or a therapist” and expressed his desire to “shoot up” his school.

    "title": "Who Is Nathan Wade? Trump Prosecutor Facing Mounting Accusations",
    "content": "As former President Donald Trump’s high-profile Georgia election interference case becomes increasingly overshadowed by his co-defendants’ conflict of interest allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, eyes have turned to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor in the Trump case whose relationship with Willis has put him at the center of those allegations. Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, has been accused of having an improper relationship  Willis hired Wade in 2022 to prosecute the criminal case against Trump and 18 co-defendants on charges of racketeering, violation of oath by a public officer and conspiracy to impersonate a public officer over Trump’s alleged scheme to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden—Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. Since his hiring, however, Wade has faced accusations that his experience did not qualify him for the lead prosecutor position in the Trump case, with Trump co-defendant Michael Roman arguing in a lawsuit against Willis that Wade’s “lack of experience” does not meet Fulton County standards “given the complexity of the charges.” Before joining the prosecution in Fulton County, Wade worked as a prosecutor and later as a judge in suburban Cobb County handling low-level criminal cases, the   reported, citing “scant evidence” of his record prosecuting major cases and no evidence of his work on a major political corruption case similar to the one Trump faces in Georgia. Wade’s record as a prosecutor primarily involves criminal defense and personal injury cases,     reported, while his law firm,  , lauds him as a “zealous advocate” with experience representing clients after major car accidents and contract disputes. Wade, who graduated from John Marshall Law School in Chicago (now part of the University of Illinois at Chicago), has also served as an assistant county solicitor—a position that handles misdemeanor cases—and   on three occasions for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court between 2012 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, Wade served as an associate municipal judge in Marietta, Georgia—just north of Atlanta—becoming the first Black man to serve as a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb. Since his hiring on the Trump case, Wade has faced criticism from multiple co-defendants, including four defendants who requested a “sanction” against Wade, including his potential “disqualification,” after Wade’s law office sent an unsolicited brochure depicting his smiling face and an advertisement for legal services to multiple defendants just weeks after their indictment in the case, the   reported. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case,   requests for punishment, finding the brochure was not sent intentionally, while admitting it was “embarrassing” for prosecutors. An attorney for Trump co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro also   Wade did not file the necessary oath of office to join the prosecution in a bid to dismiss Wade from the case—McAfee   that argument, saying the oath requirements do not apply to contractors on a single case. Nearly $654,000. That’s how much Wade has been paid by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County  . Nathan Wade was thrown into the national spotlight in the midst of two cases involving his estranged marriage with Joycelyn Wade. The saga began last month when Roman filed a   seeking to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case on the grounds that her “improper, clandestine personal relationship” with Wade constituted a conflict of interest and violated public money laws, with Wade receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. Bank records also revealed Wade and Willis went on at least two vacations together: one to the Caribbean and one to Napa Valley, California. In Roman’s suit, the Trump co-defendant cited sources close to the matter, as well as Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife. The same day Roman filed his complaint, attorneys representing Joycelyn Wade   Willis in the divorce proceedings, with Willis set to testify at a hearing on Wednesday. That hearing, however, was abruptly canceled when Nathan and Joycelyn Wade agreed to a   to resolve their divorce. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee   Willis as part of a separate investigation into allegations her office planned to misuse a federal grant from the Department of Justice earmarked for a youth empowerment program. In a court filing on Friday, committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) argued Willis’ office planned to use nearly $500,000 in federal funding from the grant on “frivolous, unrelated expenses,” including on MacBooks and travel costs—Willis denied the allegations. Jordan also accused Willis of firing a whistleblower who reportedly attempted to prevent the funds from being misused—Willis claimed the staffer was “terminated for cause.” After two weeks of accusations, Wade broke his silence Friday morning,   to having a “personal relationship” with Willis in an affidavit filed in Fulton County Superior Court, though he denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with the district attorney. Wade also argued he had “no financial interest” in Trump’s election interference case, and stressed that no income he received as special prosecutor was “shared with or provided to” Willis. Wade’s affidavit was included in a 176-page court filing Willis submitted Friday morning, in which the district attorney rejected Trump’s request for her to be removed from the case, reiterating her argument that the case for her dismissal has no legal merit. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on whether to dismiss Willis from the case. Trump, who has repeatedly targeted Willis throughout his election interference case,   Willis once again in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, claiming she was “able to get her ‘lover’ much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual,” by bringing charges against Trump.

Pentagon logo is seen ahead of a press conference at the Pentagon January 28, 2021 in Arlington,  More than 85 targets were struck in the offensive including control operations centers, intelligence centers, unmanned aerial vehicle storages and munition supply chain facilities of “militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces,” U.S. Central Command said. The strikes are likely the beginning of a larger attack that will be carried out against Iran-backed militia targets, two unnamed officials told  The Biden administration has indicated it wants to deter further attacks from militia members while avoiding a full-scale conflict with Iran, which denied involvement in the drone attack that killed three U.S. service members. President Joe Biden, who attended the dignified transfer of the fallen soldiers, acknowledged the airstrikes in a statement Friday, saying the offensive will continue “at times and places of our choosing” and that the U.S. doesn’t seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world. 160. That’s the number of attacks militia groups have made on U.S. military facilities since October, according to    . Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani told the state-controlled Islamic Republic News Agency this week the attack in Jordan that killed the American soldiers was conducted in response to “war crimes and genocide” in Gaza. Kanaani also accused Israel of trying to pull the U.S. “into a new conflict in the region and provoking it to intensify the crisis.” The militia attacks began after Hamas’ attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200. Groups such as the Yemen-based Houthi rebels have vowed to continue attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea until Israel ceases its strikes on Gaza, which have killed  , according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The U.S., which has launched airstrikes against Houthi assets in response to attacks on commercial ships, has accused Iran of supporting the rebel group.  (Forbes)  (Forbes)"

Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson appear on the ballot alongside President Joe Biden, who is heavily favored ahead of both challengers. President Joe Biden is the overwhelming favorite in the state over author Marianne Williamson and  Polls in South Carolina opened at 7 a.m. EST and will remain open until 7 p.m., though voters can cast a vote as long as they are in line at the poll’s closing time. South Carolina’s presidential primaries aren’t   to registered voters of either party, though voters are only allowed to participate in one primary. The first results are expected shortly after polls close, as the Associated Press   its first results for the state’s 2020 Democratic primary—which Biden won over Sen. Bernie Sanders—at 7:09 p.m., with about 98% of votes counted just after midnight. Biden   a 64-percentage point lead over Phillips, who is projected to receive about 5% of the votes, followed by an estimated 3% for Williamson, according to an Emerson College   last month.

The DNC’s proposal to hold the first primary in South Carolina was built on   that strong turnout from Black Democratic voters—in the state would affect elections across the country—even though polling has suggested a   for Biden among Black voters. New Hampshire Democrats still decided to hold their primary as the first on the calendar, though, going against the wishes of the national party and leading to the contest being unsanctioned and the DNC awarding no delegates for the results. Biden’s campaign announced in October he would not appear on the New Hampshire ballot to align with the DNC, making him the second sitting president in U.S. history to be omitted by the state’s primary ballot. Despite the omission, Biden still received significant write-in support that resulted in him receiving about   of the vote from Democrats, a symbolic 44-point win over Phillips.  ( )  ( )"
