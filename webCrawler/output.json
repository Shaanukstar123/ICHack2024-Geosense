    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

    "content": "French soccer star Kylian Mbappé has reportedly decided to join Real Madrid this summer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, ending months of speculation that the Spanish club could land the 25-year-old superstar. PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018. Real Madrid is the most valuable soccer team in the world,  , worth just over $6 billion."

    "content": "British Formula One star Lewis Hamilton will leave Mercedes at the end of the upcoming season and is set to join Ferrari in 2025, according to    , in what could be one of F1’s biggest moves in nearly a decade. Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

In particular, Novo said it is exploring ways to reduce reliance on “single-use injection devices,” such as introducing medicines in once-weekly, rather than daily, formulations. Novo Nordisk throttled distribution of smaller Wegovy doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients. As the drug has a risk of gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, patients are started on a smaller dose that is then increased over time to reduce any risks. The restrictions, which are still officially in place after the announcement on boosting supplies, meant many new patients could not begin treatment. Jorgensen said the increased supplies mean more U.S. patients will be able to start treatment. Novo Nordisk has been struggling to meet booming demand for Wegovy for years. The drug scored regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2021 and it has been featured on the Food and Drug Administration’s shortages list   early 2022. For much of this time, Wegovy, the brand name for a GLP-1 hormone-mimicking drug semaglutide, was the only anti-obesity drug of its kind on the market and its   has pushed Novo Nordisk to secure record profits and become one of the most valuable companies in Europe.

Ozempic also contains semaglutide but is licensed to treat diabetes, not obesity, but as it is authorized clinicians can and do prescribe it for other purposes “off label.” The U.S. is  in struggling to secure supplies of the popular drugs and   there and around the world have warned demand is helping   for counterfeits and trafficked goods. Illegal sales can be dangerous and have none of the rigorous safety guarantees pharmaceutical firms must adhere to during production, sales and shipping, such as the sterile conditions required for injected medicines.

That marks 2% revenue growth from 2022’s December quarter and 16% profit expansion, figures far more paltry than those just reported by rivals   (18% increase in sales, 33% jump in net income) and   (13% rise in sales, 52% expansion of profits). Apple’s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales—its $69.7 billion of iPhone revenue last quarter marked just a 6% annual increase but topped forecasts of $67.6 billion—and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region which accounted for about a fifth of all Apple revenue last fiscal year. Shares of Apple dipped slightly in low-volume afternoon trading, declining 4% over the last week’s standard trading hours. Apple’s lukewarm earnings report comes two days after Microsoft   its fifth-consecutive quarter of record revenue and two weeks after Apple ceded the title of the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft, a crown held by Apple since 2021. Apple’s roughly $130 billion in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat Microsoft’s $113.6 billion, but analysts project Microsoft to become more profitable than Apple by next fiscal year, a fairly remarkable feat considering Apple raked in 33% more EBITDA during the 2022 fiscal year. Wall Street expects Microsoft’s valuation ($3 trillion as of Thursday) to accordingly surge further past Apple’s ($2.9 trillion). Analysts’ average price target for Apple stock of $199 implies a projected market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, according to FactSet, while their average price target for Microsoft implies a projected market cap of $3.4 trillion."

Trump’s lawyers had argued the dossier—which came to light days before he took office—contained false, inaccurate or fabricated information about the former president and sought damages from the company for allegedly violating British data protection laws. Steyn, in a written ruling, said there are “no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed” as Trump had “chosen to allow many years to elapse -– without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction.” There is a six-year period of “limitations” that such damages need to be claimed within, Steyn reasoned, adding that the former president’s claim for damages “is bound to fail.” Steyn, who said she did not consider or determine the veracity or accuracy of the dossier’s claims, noted that the “only other remedy” Trump sought—an order to erase, or restrict processing, of his data—was “pointless, and unnecessary,” as Orbis had already deleted its copies of the dossier and it is “freely available” online anyway.

Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons.

    "title": "Is The 'God's Army' Border Convoy—With Only 50 Vehicles In Texas—A Bust? What To Know",
    "content": "The “Take Our Border Back Convoy” has begun driving through the southern U.S. on its way to several planned rallies near the border on Saturday in protest of the Biden administration’s migration policies—but the protest is reportedly off to a slow start, and has so far failed to pick up the hundreds of thousands organizers originally called to attend. The convoy will hold a rally near Eagle Pass, Texas, a city that has seen a huge surge in migrants  The group, which is   “God’s Army,” was organized partly by conservative radio hosts Scotty Saks and Kim Yeater, as well as former Army Lt. Col. Pete Chambers, who promoted the convoy on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s InfoWars last week and   on Tuesday. The convoy kicked off its multi-state journey in Virginia Beach on Tuesday, and is encouraging “active and retired law enforcement and military, Veterans, Mama Bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media, and LAW ABIDING, freedom-loving Americans” to join on the road. Organizers told the   at least 700,000 people would attend the rallies—but   reported only about 50 cars, trucks and RVs joined the convoy as it drove into Dripping Springs, Texas, on Thursday, noting the group is hoping to add more drivers has seen supporters cheer them on from the side of the highway (    reported seeing just a few dozen vehicles at other stops). The group has raised about $157,000 on donation platform   (it is unclear what Take Our Borders Back plans to spend the money on, and has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy insists it will not be “going to the border,” instead simply touring the border states—though one of its major rallies is scheduled to take place at the Cornerstone Children’s Ranch, a farm located just along the border in Quemado, Texas. At least one elected official, Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas)m told local news outlets he planned to attend one of the rallies, telling   in Dallas-Fort Worth the convoy “should be a peaceful movement by the American people” (Self has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy is planning three large rallies in border states on February 3: one in Quemado near Eagle Pass, Texas, one in Yuma, Arizona, and one in San Ysidro, California. “We are ready to roll into these peaceful assemblies in three cities … and we’re going to hold elected officials accountable,” organizer Scotty Saks said in an announcement video posted on alternative video hosting site Rumble. “Our borders and language and culture are being destroyed by this open border policy … We have solid ground for doing this event.” “God’s Army” is already facing internal friction,   reported on Wednesday. According to the report, multiple tires were slashed on convoy drivers’ cars while they stayed overnight at a hotel, and a person was kicked off one of the convoy’s buses and left on a highway shoulder. Convoy organizers seem to be blaming this on “individuals and groups actively spreading misinformation and lies” from inside the organization itself. “We have some legitimate intel from multiple sources that infiltrators, provocateurs plan to attack our convoy—either on the road or at our events,” Saks said in a video post on Rumble. Saks did not provide any direct evidence of these infiltrators, but said any potential instigators will face “the wrath of the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets who will be on the ground at our event.” The convoy comes as the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate Washington. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico are at an all-time high, after agents 2.4 million encounters over the course of 2024—up more than 4% from 2022, and more than 40% from 2021, according to  . The massive influx of migrants has overwhelmed CBP and the asylum system, which Republicans blame on President Joe Biden’s border policies, though Biden has denied claims of lax border enforcement and blamed the crisis on larger factors like poverty and violence in Central America. Eagle Pass, one of the towns the convoy is preparing to drive through, has become a focal point for migrants crossing the border into Texas, eventually compelling the state government to seize control of a local park and begin installing razor wire along the border. The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration was allowed to remove the razor wire, but Texas officials have since declared they will not let the federal government access the park and will keep installing wire. Last week, Biden endorsed a bipartisan bill that would give him the authority to shutter the southern border if crossings exceed a certain threshold and hire more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to more quickly process the massive amount of migrants in the region. In exchange, the bill would authorize more military aid to Ukraine—a major priority for Democrats. Despite the fact that the bill has not yet been released, President Donald Trump and House Republicans have begun attacking the proposed legislature, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) telling his colleagues the bill was “likely dead on arrival.” This week, the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who they accuse of violating his oath of office by not enforcing border security. The committee advanced the articles early on Wednesday morning, which could lead to a full House vote on the secretary’s impeachment."

    "title": "Washington State Fungal Infection Outbreak",
    "content": "An outbreak of a multi-drug resistant fungal infection in Washington state was reported earlier this week, and although infection is rare, experts warn its high mortality rate, drug resistance and ability to easily spread in healthcare facilities may be cause for concern. Optical microscope view of Candida auris. The Seattle and King County public health department   Tuesday it identified three confirmed cases of Candida auris infection last week, after an initial case was confirmed on January 10. Candida auris is a type of fungus that grows as yeast, and though it’s rare, it can cause severe illness and spread easily because it’s typically resistant to antifungal medications,   to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All four people were patients of Kindred Hospital Seattle, and the first confirmed case was detected through a “proactive screening program” during admission to the hospital, according to the news release from King County officials. The other three patients initially tested negative for the fungus when they were first admitted, though additional testing revealed they were positive, suggesting they were infected during their stay at the hospital. Local officials still haven’t identified the source of the outbreak, but they’re working with Kindred Hospital to keep transmissions down by keeping infected patients isolated, and notifying facilities that admit patients who were previously at Kindred. The CDC issued a   in May 2023 about an uptick of Candida auris cases spreading in healthcare facilities, labeling it an “urgent antimicrobial resistant threat.” 2,377. That’s how many Candida auris infections were reported in the U.S. in 2022—the year with the most up-to-date data—  to the CDC. Some 5,754 other people were found to have Candida auris somewhere on their body that same year, though they weren’t sick or had an active infection. Candida auris was first identified in Japan in  , where it was spotted in a patient’s ear secretion. The U.S. first began tracking infections in 2016, and it was discovered that cases dated back to 2013 in the country. Cases have since grown every year and have been reported in 36 states as of 2022, with the most drastic increase occurring during the Covid pandemic between 2020 and 2021, where the U.S. saw a 94% increase, according to CDC  . Around 95% of cases occurred in five states between 2013 and 2020: New York (41%), Illinois (26%), New Jersey (14%), California (8%) and Florida (7%). Around   of Candida auris strains are resistant to at least one antifungal, while 30% are resistant to at least two. Part of the reason the infection spreads so quickly is because it’s often   as a different fungus and not treated properly, and spreads easily through healthcare facilities. This is because the infection can live on surfaces for at least two weeks, according to a 2017   published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

According to the  , damaged and improperly used lithium batteries are at risk of sparking fires through a process called thermal runway, which quickly turns small fires into uncontrollable blazes. According to FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, lithium ion batteries have caused almost 500 fires in New York City alone in the last three years. A total of 24 people have died in these fires, including   in a Chinatown apartment located above an e-bike shop and charging station in June. At the   earlier this month, Kavanagh spoke about the ongoing threat to the public and firefighters, which she said was caused by “a perfect storm of demand for battery powered devices and a supply of cheap, unregulated products flooding in from overseas to meet this demand.”"

    "title": "2023 Child Tax Credits Could Jump Over $600 For Many Families In New Bipartisan Bill—Here’s How It Works",
    "content": "The House passed a $78 billion tax cut bill Wednesday that would expand the child tax credit for low-income families and restore corporate tax breaks, a rare moment of bipartisanship that could deliver hundreds of dollars in tax cuts and credits to some families—though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. President Joe Biden, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem  The bill expands the child tax credit for three years to cover roughly 80% of families who pay little to no income taxes and do not earn enough to qualify for a full credit, according to the left-learning  . The existing child tax credit program gives qualifying families who earn at least $2,500 per year a maximum $2,000 tax break per child, or a refund of up to $1,600 for those who owe less than $2,000 in taxes—but the size of the credit depends on a family’s income, and grows at a rate of 15 cents for every dollar earned over $2,500. The proposed changes would leave the $2,500 income floor in place, but would phase in the credit at a rate of 15% per child, rather than per family. The maximum available refund for families that pay less than $2,000 in taxes would also increase to $1,800 for the 2023 tax year, $1,900 in 2024 and $2,000 in 2025. The bill would adjust the credit for inflation beginning in the 2024 tax year, and give families the option of claiming the credit on their earnings in either the current or prior year. Most of the families that would benefit from the new credit in the 2023 tax year are in the two lowest income quintiles: about half of households earning below $21,000 a year and nearly a quarter of households with income under $40,500—amounting to an average tax cut of $680 for households that would benefit, according to the  The deal also restores a number of Trump-era tax breaks that expired in 2022, including allowing them to immediately deduct expenses for U.S.-based research and development and new equipment and machinery. $400 million. That’s how much the tax bill is expected to cost over the next 10 years. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) expressed concerns to reporters that passing legislation “that makes the president look good—mailing out checks before the election—means he could be re-elected, and then we won’t extend the 2017 tax cuts.” Unlike the one-year expansion of the program in 2021, when the credit was doled out in monthly checks, the new proposal would include the increased credit on families’ annual tax refunds. New York Republican Reps. Anthony D’Esposito, Nick LaLota, Mike Lawler and Andrew Garbarino threatened to vote against the legislation if it did not include an increase to the $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, and mortgage interest. The additional tax relief—rolling back a cap introduced during the Trump administration—is a priority for upper-middle-class earners in high-tax states like New York and could have implications for the GOP’s ability to retain control of the House in the upcoming election, as the congressmen who threatened to vote against the tax bill represent vulnerable swing districts that helped fip the House to Republican control in the 2022 midterm. The group ultimately voted in favor of the proposal after a commitment from House leadership to eventually vote on lifting the SALT cap. The House passed the legislation with bipartisan support in a 357-70 vote on Wednesday, but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to pass. The latest proposal comes after the expiration of the one-year child tax credit expansion included in the 2021 American Rescue Plan. That program increased the maximum credit to $3,000 for kids under 17 and $3,600 for kids under 6 and was fully refundable, meaning families with no income were eligible, significantly reducing the child poverty rate. Democrats have broadly championed the new benefits in the House bill, though some, including Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), said they did not go far enough, lamenting the end of the 2021 version, while some Republicans argued they went too far. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called the legislation “excessive,” arguing to the   it could evolve into “another entitlement program which is massively expensive.” DeLauro said the bill “provides billions of dollars in tax relief for the wealthy, pennies for the poor.”"

    "title": "Trump Calls Central Bank Digital Currency ‘Very Dangerous’—After Vowing To Prohibit Fed’s ‘Digital Dollar’",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump expressed heavy skepticism about the security of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which he has vowed to block, in an interview released Friday, though he personally owns   in cryptocurrency himself, according to Forbes’ estimate, and hawks a line of NFT trading cards. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after  Trump said a so-called “digital dollar” would be “very dangerous,” claiming it could create a situation where money suddenly disappears from people’s bank accounts, he told Fox News in response to a question about his plans to block the Federal Reserve from formally issuing a digital currency. The statements echo a similar claim Trump made in New Hampshire last month, where he told a crowd he would “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.” While Trump has his own personal investments in digital currency, he was critical of the industry during his presidency, calling it “highly volatile,” though Republicans’ have proposed crypto-friendly regulations and Trump, if re-elected, is likely appoint regulators who would be more aligned with digital asset firms than the Biden administration, which is largely skeptical of the industry. The Federal Reserve has not expressed a definitive stance on digital currency, but has been exploring the possibility amid the explosion of private crypto and concerns that it could morph into an unregulated currency system outside of the federal government’s purview. Trump pivoted to artificial intelligence in responding to the question about digital currency in the interview, calling AI “maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything, because there is no real solution,” he said in a preview of the interview, set to be released in full on Sunday. “The AI as they call it . . . is so scary,” he said, referencing a fake speech he recently saw of himself promoting a product he “never endorsed.” Trump, in his New Hampshire speech, likened the creation of a central bank digital currency to a form of “government tyranny,” warning it would give the federal government the ability to “take your money.” The Biden Administration issued a 2022 executive order that ordered government agencies to develop policy recommendations and a potential framework for regulating digital assets. The process for developing a central bank digital currency could take years, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last year, emphasizing that it has not made a decision on its feasibility and is still assessing the public’s appetite for such a system, which would require approval from Congress and the executive branch, Powell said. In his New Hampshire speech, Trump credited his former opponent, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for warning him of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency. Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa primary and endorsed Trump, is among the names being floated as Trump’s potential running mate pick, as he is all-but-certain to clinch the GOP nomination, potentially as soon as March. Ramaswamy has also said a central bank digital currency would create “a mechanism for the government to be able to wipe out your bank account, wipe out your dollars if you say or do something the government disapproves of” calling it “a threat to liberty in this country.” Eleven countries have established a central bank currency, citing plummeting cash usage, increased accessibility, lower infrastructure costs and improved security. More than 100 countries are currently exploring the option."

    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month.

Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory.

But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known.

    "content": "Meta just tallied its most profitable quarter—and year—ever, the Facebook parent revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report, an impressive feat considering the company’s 2022 beating reflected in its stock’s record run-up in recent months, though scars remain from billionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s panned pivot into the “metaverse.”  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before Congress on Wednesday.  Meta’s $5.33 earnings per share during the fourth-quarter and $14.87 full-year profit per share were both the highest ever recorded by the company, beating respective analyst estimates of $4.82 and $14.81, according to FactSet. The per share profit metrics are gaudier than reality due to Meta’s massive  —the company’s 2023 net income of $39.1 billion fell short of 2021’s record $39.4 billion—but it still marks a rapid turnaround from Meta’s painful 2022, as the company’s earnings per share expanded 203% year-over-year in the three-month period ending last month. Meta’s top line growth was also strong, as full-year revenue grew 25% to a record $40.1 billion, while fourth-quarter revenue was a record $134.9 billion, compared to forecasts of $39.1 billion (digital advertising accounts for about 98% of Meta’s sales). Shares of Meta soared more than 10% shortly after the earnings report’s release as the company announced another $50 billion in stock buybacks and unveiled its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share, to be paid out March 26. Meta’s after-hours share price of about $440 implies a record market value for the company of about $1.1 trillion. Despite the dramatic recovery, Meta’s financials still include ghosts from the firm’s ugly 2021-2022 stretch when its stock fell more than 75% as Zuckerberg touted his company’s push into augmented and virtual reality. Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which encompasses its metaverse endeavors led by the Oculus headset, lost $4.6 billion last quarter, a 7% wider operating loss than Q4 2022. The augmented and virtual reality segment reported a $16.1 billion loss in 2023, worse than 2022’s $13.7 billion loss and comparing negatively to Meta’s social media arm’s $62.8 billion operating profit. Wall Street is largely buying into Zuckerberg’s vision for Meta even as cash bleeds from Reality Labs. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth explained it’d be a boon for Meta if it can “simply lose less money” on the metaverse. Bank of America’s Justin Post noted Meta’s share price to earnings ratio excluding Reality Labs is far lower than the S&P 500’s, posing an “attractive core valuation” for Meta. Both Anmuth and Post have buy ratings for Meta shares, as do 81% of the analysts tracked by FactSet. Meta’s stock has surged more than 300% since bottoming out in November 2022, outgaining every stock listed on the S&P except for artificial intelligence darling Nvidia. Meta is no slouch in AI: Its generative AI large-language model   competes with those of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google, and it   is furthering use of its own semiconductor chips to power its AI systems, a solution designed to reduce Meta’s reliance on AI chip market leader Nvidia. “AI will go across everything,” Zuckerberg   Forbes this fall.

A security guard stands outside former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home on April 3, 2023, in  Federal officials   Mar-A-Lago in Aug. 2022 for White House documents Trump retained after leaving office, which resulted in them finding more than 11,000  —including more than 100 classified ones—and Trump eventually getting   for willfully retaining national defense information and obstruction, among other charges. Citing anonymous sources, ABC News   FBI officials did not search a locked closet—which investigators learned after the search that Trump had changed the lock on months earlier—while his attorney searched the property for classified materials to turn over the government in response to a subpoena. Investigators found the locked closet, but were reportedly told that the space behind the door “went nowhere” and so decided not to try and open it, according to ABC. Officials also were not aware at the time of a “hidden room” in Trump’s bedroom, and thus did not search it, ABC reports. Prosecutors questioned witnesses about the missed spaces during their investigation, with ABC reporting they focused on the rooms particularly in the three months before Trump was indicted. When asked about the rooms, the Trump campaign told ABC the investigations against the ex-president are “just desperate attempts at election interference ... to stop the presumptive Republican nominee for President.” It’s still unclear if Trump was storing any additional White House documents in his closet or hidden room, and if there are still any government materials at Mar-A-Lago or other Trump properties that haven’t been seized by the Biden administration. The Justice Department has not conducted any additional searches of Mar-A-Lago since its search in Aug. 2022, and it’s unclear if it has or at any point had any plans to do so. Former federal prosecutor Jordan Strauss told ABC the fact the FBI didn’t search the closet and hidden room was “a bit astonishing,” adding, “You're searching a former president's house. You [should] get it right the first time.” Trump has been indicted in Florida on 40 federal felony charges for retaining White House documents, and for allegedly obstructing the government’s efforts to get the documents back. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, which could result in a   of up to 450 years, if Trump were convicted on every single count and given the maximum sentence, as well as up to   in fines. The case is currently scheduled to go to trial in May, though it’s widely expected the date will get pushed back. Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who’s overseeing the case, will review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March, and the judge has already   several deadlines, which likely makes it harder for the trial to proceed on time. Trump was indicted in Florida in June 2023 following a lengthy investigation by federal prosecutors to try and recover the White House documents Trump brought back with him to Mar-A-Lago. While Trump voluntarily turned over 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives in Jan. 2022, the government then subpoenaed him for all remaining classified materials in May, to which Trump’s attorneys only turned over 38 documents. After receiving information suggesting there were still classified documents at Mar-A-Lago, the FBI searched the estate in August. Prosecutors have accused Trump of obstructing their investigation by allegedly purposely concealing documents from his attorney and investigators and not fully complying with the subpoena, including by asking his aide to move documents so they wouldn’t be found and attempting to delete security footage. The   against Trump alleges classified materials were also being stored throughout Mar-A-Lago where guests could find them, including in the estate’s ballroom and a bathroom.  (ABC News)  (Forbes)"

    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Thursday said the electric vehicle maker will hold a shareholder vote to transfer the company’s state of incorporation to Texas, after publicly lashing out at Delaware—where the company is currently incorporated—over a court decision that voided the billionaire’s massive $50.9 billion pay package.

The plaintiff argued the massive pay package was unfair to shareholders and the company’s board had failed in its fiduciary duty by approving it. In her ruling, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick pointed to Musk’s close ties with the board of directors, which was “tasked with negotiating” the pay package on behalf of Tesla. The ruling means Tesla’s board will have to come up with a new compensation plan for Musk, unless the company chooses to appeal. Musk reacted by lashing out at the state of Delaware,  : “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Companies usually pick Delaware as a state of incorporation, despite operating elsewhere due to its tax benefits and corporate-friendly laws. This isn’t the first time Musk has relied on an X poll to make an important business decision.

In December, a video of a Senate staffer having sex in a Senate building went viral.   Capitol police said it consulted with both local and federal prosecutors to determine whether to charge the individuals who allegedly appeared in the video saying that “despite a likely violation of Congressional policy — there is currently no evidence that a crime was committed.” One of the two individuals featured in the explicit video was believed to be a congressional staffer for Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) who had access to the hearing room, USCP said in a statement. Neither the staffer, Aidan Maese-Czeropski, nor the other man in the tape have cooperated with authorities in their investigation, police said. Cardin’s office did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. USCP said if new evidence were to “come to light” they would be willing to review it. \"I was angry, disappointed. It's a breach of trust,” Cardin   about the incident. In December, a graphic eight-second video of two men having sex in the Hart Senate Office Building was published by the conservative Daily Caller, and other conservative sites identified one of the men as Maese-Czeropski. Cardin’s office released a statement after the video was published saying Maese-Czeropski was no longer employed by his office, andMaese-Czeropski posted on LinkedIn that “some of my actions in the past have shown poor judgement,” but did not deny the allegations against him. The LinkedIn post has since been removed as has Maese-Czeropski’s account. Maese-Czeropski began working in Cardin’s office in October 2021. (Forbes)"

    "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Files Resolution To Censure Ilhan Omar Over Controversial—And Debated—Speech: Here’s Why",
    "content": "As GOP members ramp up calls to expel or deport Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) over controversial pro-Somali comments, far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on Thursday introduced a resolution to censure the progressive “Squad” member, though the matter of what Omar actually said and multiple translations of her speech have been called into question. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced a resolution to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.)  Omar—who was born in Somalia—has faced mounting criticism for comments she made last week at an event in Minneapolis, where she spoke in Somali, commemorating a recent election in the Somali region of Puntland. In that speech, Omar voiced concern over a   the self-declared Somaliland Republic—which is not internationally recognized—reached with landlocked Ethiopia, an agreement that would give Ethiopia access to the Red Sea, though it has drawn condemnation from the Somali government. According to a   of the speech that went viral on social media and Greene referenced in her censure resolution, Omar said the U.S. government “will only do what Somalians in the U.S. tell them to do” and that U.S. officials “must follow our orders” to “safeguard the interests of Somalia.” House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.)   those comments “anti-American” and “appalling” and pushed for an investigation into Omar, while Florida’s GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis went a step further,   Omar’s deportation and removal from Congress. That translation, posted by the right-wing X account End Wokeness, has raised eyebrows, including from Omar, who called it “inaccurate” and its wording “slanted” and “completely off,” telling the   she believes the recent attacks against her are “rooted in xenophobia and Islamophobia.” Other translations obtained by the  —including one from an unnamed federally certified court reporter—suggested Omar said the “U.S. government will do what we tell the U.S. government to do,” concluding: “that is the confidence we need to have as Somalis.” A translation by the   noted Omar said: “As long as I’m in Congress no one will take Somalia’s sea,” referring to a recent agreement. Representatives for Omar did not immediately respond to Forbes’ inquiry for comment. Greene announced her resolution to censure Omar in a   posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, claiming the Minnesota Democrat admitted to “working as a foreign agent for a foreign country,” and calling Omar’s comments “outrageous.” In that video, Greene said she wished she “had the votes to expel or deport” Omar, joining a gaggle of Republicans calling for Omar to be reprimanded. Speaking on the House floor Thursday morning, Greene urged representatives to condemn Omar’s comments, claiming Omar “made treasonous statements” while speaking at the event in Minneapolis, and arguing her comments violated her oath of office to “defend and protect” the U.S. Constitution. Greene also called for Omar to be removed from the House Budget Committee and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Greene’s resolution comes nearly one year after the House voted along party lines to   from the Foreign Affairs Committee over controversial 2019 tweets in which Omar suggested the relationship between Israel and the U.S. is “all about the Benjamins,” a comment that drew criticism from members of both parties who viewed the tweet as an antisemitic trope. Some Democrats, however,   her removal from that committee was made in revenge for the ousting of Greene and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) from their committees in 2022 over comments Greene made promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory and appearing to endorse the execution of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), while Gosar was removed after posting a video depicting him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.)—Omar supported the resolution to remove Greene and Gosar from their committees. That same year, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) vowed to remove Omar and two other Democrats from their committee assignments if elected speaker. House Democrats have also raised objections to Omar’s comments—Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) argued last year that Omar “certainly has made mistakes,” though he stopped short of voting on the resolution to eject Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. Omar is not the only high-profile Democrat facing calls for expulsion or to be censured. The GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security voted in favor of a resolution Tuesday to   Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas amid scathing criticism from Republicans over the Biden administration’s handling of a surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The resolution sends the impeachment vote to the full House. In December, the House formalized an   into President Joe Biden in a party-line vote for allegedly engaging in his son Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings—Joe and Hunter Biden have strongly denied those claims. “For as long as this continues and we allow people to serve in our government acting as foreign agents for the interests and for the good of foreign countries, and foreign peoples, our country is not safe,” Greene said Thursday."

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "title": "What Is An ARkStorm? Here’s Why California Officials Have Prepared For A ‘Megastorm’ Scenario.",
    "content": "Despite a forecast for possible “life-threatening” rainfall this weekend, California emergency officials have dispelled rumors suggesting the state soon faces an ARkStorm, a hypothetical “megastorm” scenario that scientists suggest could plausibly hit California in the future with devastating rainfall and flooding. The storm is based on weather patterns from the state’s “Great Flood of 1862.” An ARkStorm—named for an atmospheric river thought of as a 1-in-1,000-year event—was developed as a weather model in 2011 and is based on weather patterns in California between 1861 and 1862, when the state suffered from the “Great Flood of 1862,”   to the U.S. Geological Survey. The ARkStorm event would draw heat and moisture from the Pacific Ocean, which then creates a series of atmospheric rivers—long, narrow bands of atmosphere—that trigger conditions similar to the “ferocity of hurricanes” over several weeks along the West Coast. If such a storm occurred, it would result in a “statewide disaster,” the USGS said, as “extensive flooding is deemed realistic” across all of California’s counties and economic sectors. Scientists would be able to “partially” predict aspects of an ARkStorm days before the storm arrives, though California’s flood protection system isn’t designed for an ARkStorm-like event, which would produce a 500-year streamflow event across most of the state, according to the USGS. A   posted to social media last week suggested California has a 30% chance of experiencing an ARkStorm-like event within the next 30 years, suggesting the state would face the “worst natural disaster in world history.” The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services responded, indicating the video was spreading misinformation and that California residents “have nothing to fear.” The state is expected to face   atmospheric river event this weekend, which the National Weather Service warned could result in “dangerous, even life-threatening impacts.” Scientists aren’t sure whether an ARkStorm or weather pattern similar to the 1862 flood will ever hit California, though the scenario is “plausible,”   to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. California’s historic rainfall and flooding between 1861 and 1862 wasn’t a “freak event,” the USGS said, as there have been at least six similar “megastorms” that have hit the state over the last 1,800 years. $725 billion. That’s the projected cost in damages if an ARkStorm ever hits California, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Of this, about $400 billion is estimated for property damage and $325 billion in losses caused by business interruption. The estimate is based on flooding that would “realistically” disrupt thousands of square miles of urban and agricultural land, subsequently resulting in thousands of landslides and disrupting “lifelines throughout the state for days or weeks.” California officials   that more than 4,000 residents—or about 1% of the state’s population—were killed by flooding between 1861 and 1862. Several areas in the state experienced dozens of inches of rainfall during the event, including the old town of Red Dog, which recorded more than 190 inches of rain between July 1, 1861 and June 30, 1862.

    "title": "Who Is Nathan Wade? Trump Prosecutor Facing Mounting Accusations",
    "content": "As former President Donald Trump’s high-profile Georgia election interference case becomes increasingly overshadowed by his co-defendants’ conflict of interest allegations against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, eyes have turned to Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor in the Trump case whose relationship with Willis has put him at the center of those allegations. Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, has been accused of having an improper relationship  Willis hired Wade in 2022 to prosecute the criminal case against Trump and 18 co-defendants on charges of racketeering, violation of oath by a public officer and conspiracy to impersonate a public officer over Trump’s alleged scheme to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden—Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. Since his hiring, however, Wade has faced accusations that his experience did not qualify him for the lead prosecutor position in the Trump case, with Trump co-defendant Michael Roman arguing in a lawsuit against Willis that Wade’s “lack of experience” does not meet Fulton County standards “given the complexity of the charges.” Before joining the prosecution in Fulton County, Wade worked as a prosecutor and later as a judge in suburban Cobb County handling low-level criminal cases, the   reported, citing “scant evidence” of his record prosecuting major cases and no evidence of his work on a major political corruption case similar to the one Trump faces in Georgia. Wade’s record as a prosecutor primarily involves criminal defense and personal injury cases,     reported, while his law firm,  , lauds him as a “zealous advocate” with experience representing clients after major car accidents and contract disputes. Wade, who graduated from John Marshall Law School in Chicago (now part of the University of Illinois at Chicago), has also served as an assistant county solicitor—a position that handles misdemeanor cases—and   on three occasions for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court between 2012 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, Wade served as an associate municipal judge in Marietta, Georgia—just north of Atlanta—becoming the first Black man to serve as a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb. Since his hiring on the Trump case, Wade has faced criticism from multiple co-defendants, including four defendants who requested a “sanction” against Wade, including his potential “disqualification,” after Wade’s law office sent an unsolicited brochure depicting his smiling face and an advertisement for legal services to multiple defendants just weeks after their indictment in the case, the   reported. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case,   requests for punishment, finding the brochure was not sent intentionally, while admitting it was “embarrassing” for prosecutors. An attorney for Trump co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro also   Wade did not file the necessary oath of office to join the prosecution in a bid to dismiss Wade from the case—McAfee   that argument, saying the oath requirements do not apply to contractors on a single case. Nearly $654,000. That’s how much Wade has been paid by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County  . Nathan Wade was thrown into the national spotlight in the midst of two cases involving his estranged marriage with Joycelyn Wade. The saga began last month when Roman filed a   seeking to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case on the grounds that her “improper, clandestine personal relationship” with Wade constituted a conflict of interest and violated public money laws, with Wade receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. Bank records also revealed Wade and Willis went on at least two vacations together: one to the Caribbean and one to Napa Valley, California. In Roman’s suit, the Trump co-defendant cited sources close to the matter, as well as Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife. The same day Roman filed his complaint, attorneys representing Joycelyn Wade   Willis in the divorce proceedings, with Willis set to testify at a hearing on Wednesday. That hearing, however, was abruptly canceled when Nathan and Joycelyn Wade agreed to a   to resolve their divorce. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee   Willis as part of a separate investigation into allegations her office planned to misuse a federal grant from the Department of Justice earmarked for a youth empowerment program. In a court filing on Friday, committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) argued Willis’ office planned to use nearly $500,000 in federal funding from the grant on “frivolous, unrelated expenses,” including on MacBooks and travel costs—Willis denied the allegations. Jordan also accused Willis of firing a whistleblower who reportedly attempted to prevent the funds from being misused—Willis claimed the staffer was “terminated for cause.” After two weeks of accusations, Wade broke his silence Friday morning,   to having a “personal relationship” with Willis in an affidavit filed in Fulton County Superior Court, though he denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with the district attorney. Wade also argued he had “no financial interest” in Trump’s election interference case, and stressed that no income he received as special prosecutor was “shared with or provided to” Willis. Wade’s affidavit was included in a 176-page court filing Willis submitted Friday morning, in which the district attorney rejected Trump’s request for her to be removed from the case, reiterating her argument that the case for her dismissal has no legal merit. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on whether to dismiss Willis from the case. Trump, who has repeatedly targeted Willis throughout his election interference case,   Willis once again in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, claiming she was “able to get her ‘lover’ much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual,” by bringing charges against Trump.

    "content": "Local officials in California's San Mateo County have passed a resolution declaring the loneliness of its citizens to be a public health emergency, joining the governments of Japan, the U.K. the state of New York and others in looking to address an issue experts say can lead to an increased risk of life-threatening conditions. Commuters waiting on platform in the 53rd and Lexington Ave. subway station in New York City.  The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors on Thursday passed a resolution that included a pledge to help citizens connect and combat what experts have called an   of loneliness and isolation, NBC News  , making the county that includes Silicon Valley the first to take such a step. No programs were established by the resolution and no money was allocated. The move in California comes less than a year after Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy   about the \"loneliness, isolation and lack of connection\" in the United States even before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which   compounded feelings of isolation for many. Other states and countries are experiencing similar problems—the state of New York appointed an \"honorary ambassador to loneliness\" in November to address the growing problem of social isolation, the World Health Organization launched a Commission on Social Connection the same month and countries like   and the   have taken steps to address the issue. “People don’t live close to their loved ones anymore,\" Jennifer Steele, the CEO of the Meals on Wheels program that serves part of San Mateo County,  . \"Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones in some cases. Your social circle shrinks after retirement. It’s harder for people to make friends.” 24%. That's the percentage of people aged 15 or older who reported feeling very or fairly lonely in a   of people in more than 140 countries. Meta-Gallup's Global   report found people in Africa and Southwest Asia to be the most lonely. At least 40% of people in countries like Afghanistan, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Uganda reported feeling very or fairly lonely. The least lonely countries were found to be Russia, Germany, Ukraine, Sweden, Norway and Finland, among others, where less than 10% of respondents reported feeling very or fairly lonely. In the United States, 15% of people reported feeling very or fairly lonely, 36% said they were a little lonely and 59% said they don't feel lonely at all. Concerns about loneliness are not new in the medical community, and research shows it can have detrimental impacts to both mental and physical health.  published by the National Library of Medicine found that those suffering from loneliness are more likely to experience depression, alcohol abuse, personality disorders and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and cardiovascular diseases. People who find themselves suddenly alone due to the death of a loved one or a dramatic life change like retirement can be at a greater risk for a variety of mental and physical conditions, the   says, while those who purposefully engage in activities with others tend to live longer, happier lives. In a   last year, Murthy compared the risk of premature death associated with loneliness to daily smoking—the leading cause of preventable death worldwide."

    "title": "Trump Attacks Prosecutors After Jack Smith Defends Classified Materials Investigation In Unconventional Filing",
    "content": "Former President Donal Trump lashed out at the prosecutors leading criminal cases against him a day after Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith defended his investigation into Trump’s handling of classified materials against Trump’s claims that the case is politically motivated. FILE - Special counsel Jack Smith speaks about an indictment of former President Donald Trump, Aug.  Trump’s lawyers previously  a request for documents they claimed showed the basis of the investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents was “politically motivated.” But in a 67-page   to the motion Friday, argued against the request, claiming Trump’s motion seeks records “based on speculative, unsupported, and false theories of political bias and animus.” Smith’s team also took the   of using the filing to lay out a lengthy rebuttal against claims of political bias, claiming Trump’s motion “paints an inaccurate and distorted picture of events” that, if unanswered, “leave a highly misleading impression on a number of matters.” Smith argued Trump and his co-defendants “cherry-pick exhibits” and “selectively quote” from documents to put a “nefarious gloss on innocuous events” leading up to Trump’s prosecution—instead, Smith argued, Trump’s prosecution was the product of “responsible actions by government officials diligently doing their jobs” in trying to collect documents from Trump that “as a matter of law, belong to the United States.” On Truth Social on Saturday, Trump didn’t reference the filing specifically, but reasserted claims of political bias, taking aim at “Deranged Jack Smith,” as well as the prosecutors leading other criminal cases against him, calling them “(President Joe) Biden prosecutors,” leading “Biden’s investigations for purposes of ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” Forbes has contacted Trump’s legal team for comment. Among other things, Trump’s legal team has argued that officials at the National Archives made a “sham” criminal referral to the Justice Department that cited communication with Biden administration officials that ultimately kicked off the prosecution. Smith’s team rejected those claims Friday, asserting the referral was “entirely consistent\" with the government’s interest in retaining “national defense information.” The filing quoted Trump’s  : “In my administration, I’m going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.” Smith argued the communications between Archives officials and the Department of Justice were not suspicious because concerns about Trump’s keeping of classified records “had mounted for months.” Trump and co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira face a slew of charges in the documents case—including 37 counts against Trump of violating the Espionage Act, conspiring to obstruct justice and lying to investigators. The case centers on Trump’s alleged storing of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and alleged failure to cooperate with government officials who were trying to retain those documents. But Trump has long lashed out against the prosecution—and other criminal and civil cases out of Georgia and New York—as political witch hunts ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Trump faces dozens of charges across —in addition to the classified documents case, he’s been charged with racketeering in Georgia for his alleged efforts to pressure officials into overturning the 2020 election results. He’s also been charged in New York for allegedly covering up campaign finance violations by signing non-disclosure agreements over a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels and charged by Smith in another federal case for allegedly disrupting official proceedings by stoking the protests that led to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump’s prosecution in Georgia is facing headwinds amid allegations that the district attorney there, Fani Willis, had an inappropriate relationship with a prosecutor on the case. Willis this week   a personal relationship but argued it should not disqualify her from the case or affect the prosecution."
