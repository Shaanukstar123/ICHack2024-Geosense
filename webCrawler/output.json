    "title": "Underpriced Stocks In The Small-Value Corner",
    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

    "title": "Kylian Mbappé Reportedly Joining Real Madrid This Summer",
    "content": "French soccer star Kylian Mbappé has reportedly decided to join Real Madrid this summer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, ending months of speculation that the Spanish club could land the 25-year-old superstar. PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018. Real Madrid is the most valuable soccer team in the world,  , worth just over $6 billion."
