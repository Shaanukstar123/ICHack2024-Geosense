    "title": "Underpriced Stocks In The Small-Value Corner",
    "content": "professors publish a paper on a market anomaly: Over long periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks. What the hell, let’s try it, they say. So was born, 30 years ago, LSV Asset Management. It now has $96 billion to play with. The Chicago firm offers 25 strategies, covering different slices of large, medium and small companies in North American, European, Asian and emerging markets. All the portfolios use the same recipe: Find uninteres­ting, slow-growing companies. Josef Lakonishok, the ringleader of the trio and the   in the name, explains this approach with an example. He doesn’t like Nvidia, the outfit with a winning streak in chips for artificial intelligence, but he is in love with La-Z-Boy, which he describes as an “Archie Bunker” stock. LSV controls 4.4% of the lounge chair maker. “I was always a contrarian,” Lakoni­shok says. “I never liked to be like everybody else.” Value investing is scarcely a new thing. Indeed, the term   has become a cliché since money manager David Dreman popularized it in a 1977 book. But few investors have the stamina to stick with out-of-favor stocks during a growth stock stampede. Value investing, Lakonishok says, works only 60 percent of the time. Value is coming off a bad stretch. The past decade’s bull market has sent popularity contest winners Microsoft and Nvidia up tenfold and more, leaving the sleepy stocks LSV holds, like ExxonMobil and Comcast, far behind. Among pension and endowment clients with separately managed portfolios, accounting for most of LSV’s assets, there are plenty with a very long view; LSV says their returns have averaged better than two percentage points a year above returns on relevant benchmarks. The retail crowd is less patient. For five years running, Morningstar figures, more assets have been departing from LSV’s seven mutual funds, now holding a collective $2 billion, than have arrived. When value buyers give up hope, cheap stocks get even cheaper. This phenomenon is most acute among smaller companies. Over the past 20 years, LSV calculates, the cheapest third of small companies have averaged a combined value equal to 12 times earnings, while the ratio for the most expensive third has averaged 61. (The latter figure is high in part because negative earnings are incorporated in the denominator.) Today those ratios are nine for cheap stocks and 113 for expensive ones. In sum, if you must have the shares of a wanna­be Tesla or some startup talking about AI, you pay a hefty price. And you are missing the chance to acquire such LSV gems as Atkore, an electrical conduit maker, at nine times earnings, or Greif, big in bulk shipping containers, at ten times. Lakonishok had a Ph.D. from Cornell, scores of published papers and teaching stints at universities in North America and abroad when he cofounded LSV at age 47. His partners were Andrei Shleifer, a prominent Harvard economist who cashed out early, and Robert Vishny, a University of Chicago finance professor who is no longer active at LSV but retains an equity position. Now 77, Lakonishok can look back on many a boom and bust. The tech bubble of 1998–2000 was a tough episode for the young firm. Oracle, Qualcomm and Yahoo climbed to 100 and more times earnings, making value stocks look foolish. “If it had continued for another year or two, we wouldn’t be around,” he says. “Close call.” Lakonishok uses those words to describe another event in his life. When he was 13, his Lithu­anian family was able to slip through the Iron Curtain only because of a loophole involving his mother’s Polish ancestry. The family settled in Israel. English was Lakonishok’s fifth language. He recalls struggling with an entrance exam because he didn’t know the words   and  Ever cautious, Lakonishok didn’t quit his tenured professorship at the University of Illinois until 2004. He does not appear to need a salary now. All he will say about his LSV stake is that it is less than a third. Still, given the firm’s average fee near 0.4% and the overhead that would come from a staff of 43, one surmises that his family’s piece of the annual net runs well into eight figures. The LSV take on a stock is, at core, numeric. Its analysts don’t visit companies. They paid scant attention to an intriguing asset at container manufacturer Greif: 175,000 acres of timberland left over from its days making wooden barrels. But they do massage the raw numbers. Free cash flow, for example, is desirable, but the target must be adjusted for sales growth. What’s the formula? Lakonishok is not obliged to reveal it. He is no longer in the publish-or-perish sector. He will say this, about both academia and Wall Street: Beware the data miners. They comb through stock market statistics, looking at 100 possible patterns, then zero in on the one that sticks out, even though it may be no less random than the other 99. The discovery is an excuse for either an article in a journal of finance or, as the case may be, a portfolio assignment. Lakonishok has played this game. In 1992 he coauthored an entire book about the January effect, the supposed tendency of stocks beaten down by tax-loss selling to rebound after December 31. Turns out it’s hard to make money from this. How are LSV’s methods any different from data mining? “We never did anything that didn’t make common sense,” Lakonishok answers. It’s common sense that people would become enamored of market stars, even as wise men going back to Benjamin Graham in the 1930s have warned them against this behavior. It’s common sense that investors would overestimate the ability of companies like Qualcomm in 2000 or Nvidia today to keep up a sizzling growth rate. Lakonishok, who holds stocks for an average four years, has a second piece of free advice: “Investors that are lazy should be even lazier. They should trade even less.” If you dare to be a value investor, stay with it for 30 years."

    "title": "Major League Soccer’s Most Valuable Teams 2024",
    "content": "January, as Inter Miami arrived in El Salvador for its first preseason match of 2024, hundreds of cheering fans greeted the team’s convoy of pink buses,   just to catch a glimpse of, arguably, the most famous athlete on the planet, Lionel Messi. Such an impassioned welcome in a foreign country would have been unimaginable eight months ago when Inter Miami, one of the more recent additions to Major League Soccer, was a last-place club with little global recognition beyond its minority co-owner, David Beckham. But that all changed in June when Messi announced that South Florida would become his next soccer home, forever altering the franchise’s trajectory. “From the European mentality, a club, an institution is always bigger than an individual because an individual is part of the story,” says Xavier Asensi, Inter Miami’s chief business officer, who previously ran commercial operations at FC Barcelona for more than a decade. “Messi is huge in terms of FC Barcelona’s story. When you go to Inter Miami, here it’s not that the player is bigger than the club—the player is bigger than the league.” His impact was immediate. A month after his arrival, Messi led Inter Miami to its first-ever trophy, at the inaugural Leagues Cup, with a dramatic penalty shootout victory. Off the field, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner supercharged the team’s business operations, with revenue more than doubling to $118 million in 2023, from $56 million in 2022. The rapid change in fortune has fueled the club’s appreciation.   estimates Inter Miami is now the second-most-valuable MLS team, worth $1.03 billion after a 72% bump from a year ago. The franchise is the second in league history to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, following in the cleated footsteps of LAFC,   and remains MLS’s most valuable team, at $1.2 billion. However, Messi’s presence on the roster isn’t solely responsible for Inter Miami’s $430 million value increase year-over-year. The club has shrewdly capitalized on its megastar’s commercial potential, starting even before he arrived. During its years-long courtship of Messi, Inter Miami pushed to add escalator clauses to its sponsorship agreements that would take effect if it acquired a player of the 36-year-old soccer legend’s caliber. It also lined up several partnerships to expire around Messi’s anticipated arrival, including its kit sponsorship with cryptocurrency exchange XBTO. Last month, Inter Miami officially announced that Royal Caribbean would take over that spot in a deal the largest of its kind in MLS history. The first full season with Messi in the United States offers even more upside, including increased stadium attendance and higher average ticket prices. Inter Miami finished   two weeks after the 2023 season concluded. The Argentine forward’s massive popularity has also opened new lines of business for the club, like its   through El Salvador, Dallas, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Japan. Inter Miami projects it will surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would set a league record. “This is a tsunami, and either you are ready to surf it—or you are beneath it,” Asensi says. “I think we were ready to swim and surf, but mindset-wise, it’s something that we still have to work on.” Inter Miami now has an unparalleled window to transform its business, but it could close soon. Messi is under contract for only two seasons, with an option for 2026, and the franchise risks regressing financially after his departure. The club will get a boost in 2025 when it moves into its new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, although it still must figure out how to retain as much fan interest, global popularity and brand equity as possible from the Messi era. The league faces a similar quandary. While MLS has thrived locally, it lacks the blockbuster national media rights revenue of other major North American sports leagues like the NFL and the NBA. Magnifying the issue is the fact that more than half of MLS teams are money-losing enterprises, leaving owners responsible for financial shortfalls and capital calls to finance league operations. “A lot of folks that have money want to make sure they keep the money and aren’t willing to continue to fund losses into perpetuity,” says Edwin E. Draughan of sports investment bank Park Lane. Messi’s move to Miami doubled the subscriber count of MLS Season Pass, the league’s subscription streaming service with Apple, which will bring in at least $2.5 billion over 10 years. Retaining those customers after Messi finishes his MLS tenure will be crucial, especially considering the deal’s upside. At an undisclosed subscriber threshold, Apple and MLS share revenue. (Messi’s compensation includes a cut either way.) The streaming service hasn’t reached that threshold yet, although Messi’s popularity has inspired optimism that it could come sooner rather than later. The World Cup in 2026 could also be a growth engine for MLS. Having emerged in the aftermath of the 1994 tournament, the league is banking much of its future growth on the games returning to North American soil. The Messi-driven surge in popularity, plus other major events coming to the U.S. like Copa América in 2024, could act as a bridge. How MLS will directly commercialize the opportunity is still unclear, though. “When Team USA is doing well in the World Cup, all of a sudden America loves soccer,” Draughan says. “There’s a way that MLS is perfectly well positioned to capitalize on that success just from increased interest, increased demand. In terms of a direct way, it’s hard to really quantify.” In the meantime, Inter Miami isn’t the only franchise reaping the rewards of its game-changing acquisition. Clubs lucky enough to host games against Miami in 2023 scored massive gate-revenue increases, including the New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC and the Chicago Fire, which drew 62,124 fans to Soldier Field for a game in which Messi never actually played. Those bumps, additional games from the Leagues Cup and a move by MLS to decrease the ticket revenue it collects from teams to 10%, from 33%, helped power a 20% increase in average revenue across the league to $66 million in 2023. Also bolstering the league are the rising valuations across other major American sports; for ultra-high-net-worth individuals with dreams of owning a sports team, MLS remains a cost-friendly option.   now estimates the average MLS club is worth $658 million, up 14% from a year ago. Making its first-ever appearance on the list is St. Louis City SC, which ranks 11th at $680 million after joining the league for a $200 million expansion fee in 2019. The club was a roaring success in its first season in 2023, winning an MLS-expansion-team-record 17 games, selling out all 18 of its home matches and ranking second in merchandise sales on the league’s online store, behind only Inter Miami. St. Louis posted an estimated $70 million in revenue for 2023, tied with NYCFC for the 10th-best mark in MLS. LAFC, which claims the No. 1 spot for the second consecutive year at $1.2 billion, turned a $9 million operating profit on a league-high $140 million in revenue for 2023. The club added a 10-year, $100 million   prior to last season and, in July, drew an MLS single-game record 82,110 fans to the Rose Bowl  . LAFC pads its bottom line with a suite of non-MLS businesses, including concerts and other events. BMO Stadium sold more than 1.3 million tickets in 2023, and Pollstar ranked the venue No. 5 on   with a gross of $109 million despite a capacity of only 22,000. LAFC has also  , adding a 90% stake in Switzerland’s Grasshopper Club Zurich to a portfolio that includes a piece of Austrian fourth-tier club FC Wacker Innsbruck and a joint venture with German powerhouse Bayern Munich. “Clearly, the market is very strong here in L.A.,” Draughan says. “And they’ve been able to capitalize.” Forbes Forbes"

PSG's Kylian Mbappe reacts during the French League One soccer match between Strasbourg and Paris  French newspaper Le Parisien first reported the news, with ESPN further   Saturday, citing unnamed sources. Sources told ESPN Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid, but his decision has been made and a decision could be announced next week. Mbappé has been with PSG since 2017, when he first joined the club on loan from Monaco—PSG fully assumed his contract rights the next year. Mbappé is widely considered one of the best players of his generation. He won a World Cup with France at age 19 in 2018 and was named the best young player of the tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, he was top scorer with eight goals as France made another run to the final, ultimately falling to Lionel Messi-led Argentina in penalty kicks. At the club level, he has been the top or co-lead scorer in France’s Ligue 1 for the past five seasons. He is again top scorer for this season so far with 20 goals—twice as many as the next-leading scorer. Mbappé’s tenure with PSG has long been accompanied by   of potential departures—and Real Madrid has been the top rumored landing place. In 2022, Real Madrid made a big-ticket offer to lure Mbappé away, but PSG was able to   to another two-year contract, which expires this August. Mbappé is the third-highest paid athlete in the world,   to Forbes’ latest World’s Highest Paid Athletes list, with total earnings of $120 million. Mbappé trails only Lionel Messi, who left PSG last year for Inter Miami, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Real Madrid from 2009 to 2018.

    "title": "Why Biden Can’t Easily ‘Shut Down The Border’—As Both He And Trump Have Suggested",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump amped up his campaign Wednesday against border legislation being negotiated in Congress, claiming President Joe Biden has the immediate authority to shut down the border amid a surge in migrant crossings—but closing the border would prove legally and practically challenging, and Biden argues he can’t crack down on crossings unless Congress passes the immigration bill. Migrants attempt to cross the Mexico-United States border along razor wire, despite heightened  Trump on Wednesday called the legislation—which is being negotiated in exchange for additional aid to Ukraine—a “stupid bill” and urged lawmakers to “make sure it doesn’t get passed,” pressuring Biden to “close the southern border” and insisting there is “no bill necessary” in a Truth Social post. Trump’s campaign has caused many of his allies in Congress to sour on the border deal, and Biden, in turn, has blamed the GOP for blocking him from executing “emergency authority” to “shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed.” The term “shutdown” is likely a form of hyperbole, as closing legal ports of entry would be an extreme and unprecedented measure that would disrupt trade and U.S.-Mexico relations, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council. Instead, many Republicans have pushed Biden to crack down on unauthorized border crossings that have hovered near record levels in recent years. No administration could automatically force universal deportations for anyone caught in the U.S. illegally, however, under what Reichlin-Melnick described as “crystal clear” immigration law that grants any foreign national on U.S. soil the right to seek asylum, which is afforded to those who can prove they faced persecution in their home countries—regardless of whether they entered the United States through legal means. Republicans have suggested Biden should drastically curtail asylum claims by reimposing more restrictive Trump-era immigration policies like Title 42 (which let federal officials rapidly expel unauthorized migrants to Mexico under the Covid-19 emergency) or the “Remain in Mexico” program (which required most asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico)—but both policies are controversial and have faced legal challenges, along with resistance from Mexico. Biden argues the legislation being negotiated in the Senate would let him effectively “shut down” the border by raising the threshold for asylum and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to limit crossings to 1,400 per day if migrant encounters exceed a threshold,     reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. It would also speed up the asylum process for people who legally present themselves at ports of entry and require people caught in the country illegally to be detained while their asylum interviews are conducted, and removed within 15 days if they fail the interview, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), one of the Senate negotiators working on the deal, explained to reporters Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), echoing Trump, has claimed Biden could automatically deport anyone who was caught crossing illegally under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which Trump used to impose the controversial travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. This too is a fraught proposal, according to Reichlin-Melnick, noting that the courts struck down Trump’s attempt to prohibit people caught violating the order from seeking asylum, a right enshrined in a patchwork of international and U.S. immigration law implemented over the past 100-some years. While the details of the border-Ukraine deal being negotiated in the Senate have been closely guarded, some Republicans—even those who are in favor of aiding Ukraine, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—have expressed outrage in recent weeks that it does not include tighter restrictions on parole, which allows migrants in emergency situations to safely and legally cross the border through airports and other official means. But the timing of the stalled negotiations aligns with Trump’s sudden interest in killing it—a fact Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)   acknowledged in a meeting with the GOP conference last week, telling lawmakers “we don’t want to do anything to undermine” Trump. Johnson   the proposed Senate bill, as is, is dead-on-arrival in the GOP controlled House, citing Republican demands for a string of more restrictive policies, including the re-implementation of “Remain in Mexico,” new limitations on asylum and parole and additional border wall construction. Former DHS officials warned that curtailing crossings to the degree reportedly proposed in the pending legislation could crowd portions of the border south of Mexico, they told  , adding the measures would only be possible with Mexico’s cooperation. What’s more, is that removing anyone who is caught on U.S. soil after crossing the border illegally would require additional asylum officers to conduct what’s known as the “credible fear process,” a pre-screening to determine if their asylum claims warrant review, Reichlin-Melnick said. Immediate detention for most people caught in the U.S. illegally, as described by Sinema, could anger Biden’s base while it also threatens to overwhelm detention facilities. 52%. That’s the share of voters who trust Trump more than Biden (30%) to handle immigration, according to a Bloomberg-Morning Consult   released Wednesday. The survey found 59% of voters rate immigration as a “very important” issue in the presidential election. Immigration policy has vexed the Biden administration throughout this tenure as the number of unauthorized crossings have surged, reaching a monthly record high in December. Many of the migrants hail from Central America, Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, and have asked for asylum from political repression or rampant gang violence. The influx follows the May expiration of the pandemic-era public health law, Title 42, that allowed border agents to turn away migrants seeking asylum on the grounds that it could lead to increased spread of Covid-19. The Biden Administration also ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” policy in August 2022, following a protracted court battle with Texas and Missouri. Biden promised to eliminate both policies during his 2020 campaign, and there are also practical reasons why neither are likely to be re-implemented. The Mexican government has said it will not cooperate with any reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy, and the Supreme Court has already ruled the Biden administration had the right to end it. Title 42 is no longer applicable since the federal public health emergency expired in May. Biden has requested funding for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers and fentanyl-detection technology as part of his proposed fiscal year 2024 budget that is under negotiation in Congress."

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has navigated a trying month for his firm. Boeing generated $22 billion of sales during the fourth quarter, easily beating consensus analyst estimates of $21.2 billion compiled by FactSet, while its $0.47 loss per share also beat forecasts of $0.78.

With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

    "content": "Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk will boost supplies of its wildly popular obesity drug Wegovy in the United States this year, mitigating—but likely not ending—shortages as it   but struggles to meet growing demand while expanding into new markets. Wegovy injector pens are authorized to help people with obesity.  Novo Nordisk “started gradually increasing” supplies of lower doses of Wegovy in January, the company   Wednesday, months after it throttled provisions to “safeguard continuity of care.” The company will more than double the quantity of lower doses reaching the U.S. compared to recent months, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters in a call discussing the firm’s stellar  . Novo Nordisk will also gradually increase overall supply of the anti-obesity drug throughout the rest of 2024, the company confirmed to Forbes in an email. In its  , the drugmaker said it is exploring other ways to shore up scarce supplies of in-demand medicines, adding that it has invested nearly $11 billion in expanding global production capacity. The company said it is also “thinking strategically” about how to remove bottlenecks from its supply chain, singling out disposable auto-injector pens patients use to deliver Wegovy and other medications in its catalog. In particular, Novo said it is exploring ways to reduce reliance on “single-use injection devices,” such as introducing medicines in once-weekly, rather than daily, formulations. Novo Nordisk throttled distribution of smaller Wegovy doses in the U.S. in May in order to safeguard supplies for existing patients. As the drug has a risk of gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, patients are started on a smaller dose that is then increased over time to reduce any risks. The restrictions, which are still officially in place after the announcement on boosting supplies, meant many new patients could not begin treatment. Jorgensen said the increased supplies mean more U.S. patients will be able to start treatment. Novo Nordisk has been struggling to meet booming demand for Wegovy for years. The drug scored regulatory approval in the U.S. in 2021 and it has been featured on the Food and Drug Administration’s shortages list   early 2022. For much of this time, Wegovy, the brand name for a GLP-1 hormone-mimicking drug semaglutide, was the only anti-obesity drug of its kind on the market and its   has pushed Novo Nordisk to secure record profits and become one of the most valuable companies in Europe. Semaglutide’s weight-loss properties have also contributed to   of another of Novo’s blockbusters: Ozempic. Ozempic also contains semaglutide but is licensed to treat diabetes, not obesity, but as it is authorized clinicians can and do prescribe it for other purposes “off label.” The U.S. is  in struggling to secure supplies of the popular drugs and   there and around the world have warned demand is helping   for counterfeits and trafficked goods. Illegal sales can be dangerous and have none of the rigorous safety guarantees pharmaceutical firms must adhere to during production, sales and shipping, such as the sterile conditions required for injected medicines. Some patients in Austria and Britain have been   after using products that may have contained insulin instead of the advertised semaglutide. 50 million. That’s how many people with obesity should be able to get healthcare coverage for Wegovy in the U.S., Novo Nordisk  . Around 10 million would access this through Medicaid and 40 million through commercial coverage, the company said. It estimates there are around 110 million adults living with obesity in the country."

    "title": "Billionaire Peter Thiel Backs Doping-Friendly Olympics Rival — What To Know About The ‘Enhanced Games’",
    "content": "Billionaire PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel has   in a drug-friendly sports contest styled as a “modern reinvention of the Olympic Games,” part of a movement embracing ways science and technology can enhance human performance that critics argue endangers both athletes’ health and sport itself. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies, has invested in the Enhanced Games.  Thiel was revealed as an investor in a “multi-million dollar” seed round on Tuesday for the Enhanced Games, a privately funded sporting contest that describes itself as the “Olympics of the future.” Thiel is joined by the likes of  , a cryptocurrency investor and former CTO of Coinbase, and  , a biotech investor who said the games “will undoubtedly inspire the public’s imagination.” The Enhanced Games said it will not test athletes for drugs or other performance enhancers at its events—it is not clear when the first competition will take place—explaining it “embrace[s] the inclusion of science in sports” and is “unencumbered by anachronistic legacy systems” that are “ ” and stigmatize “enhanced athletes.” The contest   it is aiming to be the “safest international sporting event in history” and will require full medical screens on athletes competing to monitor any risks. While the “Enhanced Movement” stresses enhancements as a “personal” choice for competitors, the contest’s website says it “embraces enhanced athletes” and wants to push the “perceived limit” of what is possible, with the ultimate goal of setting new world records. Team sports have been culled from the contest to better focus on individual prowess, and events will be held across five core sporting categories: athletics, aquatics, combat, gymnastics and strength. The Enhanced Games says it is going to be the “most inclusive sports league in history.” All adults will be welcome to apply to compete in the games, organizers said, regardless of whether they are “natural, adaptive, or enhanced, an amateur or a former Olympian.” Registration will open in late 2024. Precise dates for the contest are not yet known. “Contemporary drug testing practised in sports today is not necessarily about athlete safety; it often skews the public perception of fairness and health in competitive sports,” said Michael Sagner, a member of the games’ scientific and medical advisory board and a clinician and researcher in aging and sports medicine at King’s College London. Sagner said Enhanced will adopt a “sophisticated safety protocol” that will put athletes’ health first. The Enhanced Games’ organizers say they hope to avoid the excessive waste and costs associated with the modern Olympic Games. The Enhanced Games have been designed so they can be hosted at a Division One university campus, its website said, avoiding the need to build new stadiums and push cities into debt. It will also mean athletes can be paid fairly, boasts Aron D’Souza, president of the Enhanced Games. While the Olympic Games can generate billions in revenue, successful athletes see only a   of the bounty. “By focusing on world records in popular sports such as track and field, swimming, gymnastics, weight lifting and combat sports, we can eliminate wasteful infrastructure spending and reinvest to fairly pay all athletes.” It’s not clear how much athletes competing in the Enhanced Games stand to win. The games’ organizers   an exact prize pool and compensation structure will be announced in the middle of 2024. All athletes will be paid a base salary and will compete for additional prize winnings, organizers said. By nature, competitive athletes strive to be the very best at what they do and train hard to achieve this. Inevitably, athletes look beyond themselves for ways of getting an edge, which can range from an improved diet, training at high altitudes and exploiting advances in sports medicine and psychology to high-tech gear like bikes, shoes and swimming costumes, blood doping and drugs. A number of these methods, notably using drugs, have potentially negative health consequences for athletes and are viewed as giving an unfair advantage over other competitors. While there is no clear consensus on where the dividing line is between permissible and impermissible enhancement—the boundary often changes with new scientific advances as well—high level contests frequently test athletes to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Athletes in many professional leagues can be sanctioned or barred from competition for doping, and some fans reject any   who used performance-enhancing drugs. Critics   efforts like the Enhanced Games put athletes’ health at risk and undermine the integrity and fairness of sporting competition. Travis Tygart, CEO of the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN the idea of such a contest is “farcical,” adding that it’s “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” It’s also likely illegal in many states on account of the legal status of some performance enhancers like anabolic steroids, which can help boost muscle mass, Tygart said. Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was   from competing internationally for four years on Monday for an anti-doping violation from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. She had won gold in the team figure skating event, though the medal has now   to Team USA. We estimate   has a net worth of $6.2 billion. The sum positions him as the 443rd   on Forbes’ list of real-time billionaires. Thiel cofounded PayPal and big data firm Palantir and was the first big investor in Facebook.  (The Verge)"

Judge Karen Steyn   Trump’s claim against Orbis Business Intelligence over a   it compiled that alleged Trump conspired with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election, bribed Russian officials and took part in “perverted sexual acts” in Russia that gave Moscow material with which to blackmail him. Trump’s lawyers had argued the dossier—which came to light days before he took office—contained false, inaccurate or fabricated information about the former president and sought damages from the company for allegedly violating British data protection laws. Steyn, in a written ruling, said there are “no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed” as Trump had “chosen to allow many years to elapse -– without any attempt to vindicate his reputation in this jurisdiction.” There is a six-year period of “limitations” that such damages need to be claimed within, Steyn reasoned, adding that the former president’s claim for damages “is bound to fail.” Steyn, who said she did not consider or determine the veracity or accuracy of the dossier’s claims, noted that the “only other remedy” Trump sought—an order to erase, or restrict processing, of his data—was “pointless, and unnecessary,” as Orbis had already deleted its copies of the dossier and it is “freely available” online anyway. In a   of the ruling, the court said Trump had “no real prospect of obtaining any of the remedies he sought.” Buzzfeed News set Washington ablaze in early 2017 when it published a   filled with scandalous allegations about Trump and his purported links to Russia.

The consultancy claims it had not been the one to make the “Steele Dossier” public and Trump has repeatedly denied its findings. The report was   commissioned by Hillary Clinton’s Democrats and other Trump opponents. On the last day of his presidency, Trump declassified testimony from Steele about the former president’s links to Russia. Steele, who is British,  the decision as “reckless” and in October claimed two Russian sources had not been heard from since. Steyn said she thought Trump’s real purpose for pursuing Orbis was not for damages but as a final attempt at rehabilitating his reputation after failing for years through other means. “In reality, the claimant is seeking court findings to vindicate his reputation in circumstances where has not been able to formulate any viable remedy which he would have a real prospect of obtaining, or which would itself be of any utility,” Steyn wrote. Orbis had   Trump brought the claim merely to air “longstanding grievances” against the company and Steele.  (CNN)  (BBC)"

    "title": "Is The 'God's Army' Border Convoy—With Only 50 Vehicles In Texas—A Bust? What To Know",
    "content": "The “Take Our Border Back Convoy” has begun driving through the southern U.S. on its way to several planned rallies near the border on Saturday in protest of the Biden administration’s migration policies—but the protest is reportedly off to a slow start, and has so far failed to pick up the hundreds of thousands organizers originally called to attend. The convoy will hold a rally near Eagle Pass, Texas, a city that has seen a huge surge in migrants  The group, which is   “God’s Army,” was organized partly by conservative radio hosts Scotty Saks and Kim Yeater, as well as former Army Lt. Col. Pete Chambers, who promoted the convoy on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s InfoWars last week and   on Tuesday. The convoy kicked off its multi-state journey in Virginia Beach on Tuesday, and is encouraging “active and retired law enforcement and military, Veterans, Mama Bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media, and LAW ABIDING, freedom-loving Americans” to join on the road. Organizers told the   at least 700,000 people would attend the rallies—but   reported only about 50 cars, trucks and RVs joined the convoy as it drove into Dripping Springs, Texas, on Thursday, noting the group is hoping to add more drivers has seen supporters cheer them on from the side of the highway (    reported seeing just a few dozen vehicles at other stops). The group has raised about $157,000 on donation platform   (it is unclear what Take Our Borders Back plans to spend the money on, and has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy insists it will not be “going to the border,” instead simply touring the border states—though one of its major rallies is scheduled to take place at the Cornerstone Children’s Ranch, a farm located just along the border in Quemado, Texas. At least one elected official, Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas)m told local news outlets he planned to attend one of the rallies, telling   in Dallas-Fort Worth the convoy “should be a peaceful movement by the American people” (Self has not returned a request for comment from Forbes). The convoy is planning three large rallies in border states on February 3: one in Quemado near Eagle Pass, Texas, one in Yuma, Arizona, and one in San Ysidro, California. “We are ready to roll into these peaceful assemblies in three cities … and we’re going to hold elected officials accountable,” organizer Scotty Saks said in an announcement video posted on alternative video hosting site Rumble. “Our borders and language and culture are being destroyed by this open border policy … We have solid ground for doing this event.” “God’s Army” is already facing internal friction,   reported on Wednesday. According to the report, multiple tires were slashed on convoy drivers’ cars while they stayed overnight at a hotel, and a person was kicked off one of the convoy’s buses and left on a highway shoulder. Convoy organizers seem to be blaming this on “individuals and groups actively spreading misinformation and lies” from inside the organization itself. “We have some legitimate intel from multiple sources that infiltrators, provocateurs plan to attack our convoy—either on the road or at our events,” Saks said in a video post on Rumble. Saks did not provide any direct evidence of these infiltrators, but said any potential instigators will face “the wrath of the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets who will be on the ground at our event.” The convoy comes as the migrant crisis at the southern border continues to dominate Washington. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico are at an all-time high, after agents 2.4 million encounters over the course of 2024—up more than 4% from 2022, and more than 40% from 2021, according to  . The massive influx of migrants has overwhelmed CBP and the asylum system, which Republicans blame on President Joe Biden’s border policies, though Biden has denied claims of lax border enforcement and blamed the crisis on larger factors like poverty and violence in Central America. Eagle Pass, one of the towns the convoy is preparing to drive through, has become a focal point for migrants crossing the border into Texas, eventually compelling the state government to seize control of a local park and begin installing razor wire along the border. The Supreme Court ruled the Biden administration was allowed to remove the razor wire, but Texas officials have since declared they will not let the federal government access the park and will keep installing wire. Last week, Biden endorsed a bipartisan bill that would give him the authority to shutter the southern border if crossings exceed a certain threshold and hire more Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and asylum officers to more quickly process the massive amount of migrants in the region. In exchange, the bill would authorize more military aid to Ukraine—a major priority for Democrats. Despite the fact that the bill has not yet been released, President Donald Trump and House Republicans have begun attacking the proposed legislature, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) telling his colleagues the bill was “likely dead on arrival.” This week, the GOP-led House Committee on Homeland Security introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who they accuse of violating his oath of office by not enforcing border security. The committee advanced the articles early on Wednesday morning, which could lead to a full House vote on the secretary’s impeachment."

That marks 2% revenue growth from 2022’s December quarter and 16% profit expansion, figures far more paltry than those just reported by rivals   (18% increase in sales, 33% jump in net income) and   (13% rise in sales, 52% expansion of profits). Apple’s tepid growth can largely be traced to lackluster growth in iPhone sales—its $69.7 billion of iPhone revenue last quarter marked just a 6% annual increase but topped forecasts of $67.6 billion—and a 15% annual decline in sales in greater China, a historically high-growth region which accounted for about a fifth of all Apple revenue last fiscal year.

Apple’s roughly $130 billion in 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) beat Microsoft’s $113.6 billion, but analysts project Microsoft to become more profitable than Apple by next fiscal year, a fairly remarkable feat considering Apple raked in 33% more EBITDA during the 2022 fiscal year. Wall Street expects Microsoft’s valuation ($3 trillion as of Thursday) to accordingly surge further past Apple’s ($2.9 trillion).

A spokesperson for Snap told Forbes they determined the overheating risk was isolated to a “very small number of cases,” but the company opted to recall all of the drones out of a concern for community safety.

    "title": "Inside Saudi Arabia’s $800 Billion Tourism Moonshot",
    "content": "hatever your preconceived notion of Saudi Arabia as a travel destination is, it’s about to be get a major renovation. Imagine Sindalah, for example, a   with three ultra-luxe resorts, 38 high-end restaurants and multiple superyacht marinas. Or Qiddiya, a   of 600,000 people rising from the desert floor, dedicated to esports and gaming. How about Trojena, a space-age   built above the high desert? Or The Red Sea, a   of 50 luxury resorts and 8,000 hotel rooms spread across 22 islands in a Maldives-style archipelago—powered entirely by wind and solar energy? Also in the works is The Rig, a   built on an off-shore oil platform. In addition, Saudi Arabia is positioning itself as a major cruise destination, with   having recently bought a $300-million ship. Across the Kingdom, new roads, airports, golf courses and cruise terminals are rising from the sand. The map is literally being redrawn in real time. Then there are all the new hotels, with their thousands of freshly built rooms. The world’s most iconic hospitality companies—Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, St. Regis, Fairmont, Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt and InterContinental—are falling over themselves to jump into a construction pipeline that’s churning faster than anywhere else in the world. Any one of these projects might momentarily pierce the travel industry’s fleeting attention span. But together, what’s going on in Saudi Arabia simply cannot be ignored. Indeed, it can be often difficult to visualize the vastness of Saudi Arabia’s physical transformation. Some of the most notable ongoing projects—including Sindalah, the 7-star private island, and Trojena, the improbable desert ski resort—fall within NEOM, a $500-billion built-from-scratch region in northwest Saudi Arabia where the Kingdom is creating new cities, resorts and other developments. At 10,200 square miles and bounded by the Red Sea to the south and the Gulf of Aqaba to the west, it’s roughly the size of Albania. Fantasy Island: Sindalah will feature 88 villas, 333 apartments, 51 luxury retail stores and an 86-berth superyacht marina. Bankrolled mainly by the Kingdom’s $700-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF), the idea for NEOM was born out of  , Saudi Arabia’s grand plan to shake off its historic reliance on oil and diversify its economy. One of the scheme’s pillars involves reinventing the country as a global tourism juggernaut. When first announced in 2016, the Kingdom’s tourism goals seemed fanciful: Attract 100 million foreign and domestic visitors to the country every year and grow tourism’s share of the economy from about 3% to 10%. Oh, and do it all in just 14 years. That aspiration seemed all the more preposterous given that, in 2016, Saudi Arabia had not yet opened its doors to international leisure travelers. At the time, travel to the Kingdom was almost entirely restricted to three types of people: expatriate workers, those with business visas, and religious pilgrims visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Then in 2019,   it would provide e-visas and visas on arrival to visitors from 49 countries, including the United States. Among other changes announced at the time: Female visitors would be exempted from wearing an abaya, the traditional and otherwise obligatory head-to-toe robe, in public places and would be allowed to travel without a male companion. Tourists would still be required to dress modestly and Mecca would remain off-limits to non-Muslims. Since Saudi Arabia opened to the international travel market, the speed and spare-no-expense approach to its transformation has stunned even the most seasoned tourism analysts. “We’re seeing hugely ambitious plans, huge amounts of development,” says Caroline Bremner, head of travel and tourism research at  . “Billions, ultimately trillions, worth of dollars being invested in infrastructure and in diversifying their economy.” The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimated the Kingdom has already spent $800 billion, and that doesn’t include the massive amounts of foreign investments pouring in. The pandemic delayed some projects, of course, but rather than scaling back expectations, the Saudis ratcheted up their goal to 150 million annual visitors by 2030. Here’s where semantics come into play. In tourism parlance, a “visitor” is defined as someone who visits a site within the country, which is very different from what Euromonitor deems an “arrival,” someone who makes an overnight stay. (Other organizations sometimes call the latter “tourists.”) Saudi Arabia had over 24 million foreign arrivals in 2023 and will welcome nearly 37 million in 2030, according to Euromonitor projections. “So if each of those 37 million overnight tourists visits three sites, you pretty much have got your 100 million visits,” Bremner says. “Then add on top of that your domestic tourists, and their own set targets are quite achievable.” A more meaningful measure of success is how much foreigners are expected to spend while in Saudi Arabia. Euromonitor predicts that international tourists will spend $38 billion in 2030. But the total economic impact for Saudi Arabia will be far greater after adding in domestic travelers’ expenditures and the ripple effect of one million new tourism jobs. The WTTC projects that, by 2032, Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector could contribute nearly $169 billion to its GDP, representing 17.1% of the total Saudi economy. Waterworld: The Red Sea Global project features several luxury resorts, including one with overwater bungalows. “Remember, they’re building this destination on the ledger, essentially from scratch, for the international market, and they are bringing in the best of the best in terms of the quality of people they’re working with” says Bremner. “I can see that they’ve thought through every single aspect of tourism, from the staff to the product, the brand, the service, the connectivity, the sustainability. So it really does feel like they’re building something for the next century ahead.” Preparing for the future also means recognizing the seismic shift in what the next generations of global travelers will want. Roughly 90% of young Chinese travelers and 70% of Gen Z travelers in the UK, Australia and India say they are looking to discover new destinations, according to data from  . In that sense, being the new kid on the tourism block is an enormous plus. “New generations have a lot more information through social media,” Billy Canellas, head of asset management at NEOM,   at the Skift Global Forum East in December. “[Younger travelers] are very well educated about the effects of overtourism in traditional destinations,” he added, noting “a clear tendency towards the eco-friendly and sustainable destinations” and an eagerness to learn about a destination’s “culture and the traditions of diversity.” “The luxury market is getting more diverse and younger, and it's shifting to the emerging markets,” says Bremner, noting that the United Arab Emirates, India and China are all highly appealing to this demographic. “We have this fresh-faced luxury traveler, and it's not the traditional older generation of travelers with lots of money. It’s the New World luxury traveler, highly digital, very environmentally conscious, and for whom social impact is important.” “Make no mistake,” says Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, “what Saudi Arabia is doing is they’re identifying who are some of the most important travelers are—the people willing to spend a lot of money on experiences—and asking, How do we go get them?” There are, of course, many ways for the Saudi grand vision to go sideways. First, there are enormous financial risks inherit in tackling so many giga projects all at once, even for a country with bottomless pockets. “The Saudis are running at 82% public debt compared to government revenue,” Bremner says, noting that official public debt as a percentage of GDP was 23.8% in 2023. Still, it’s all relative. The Kingdom’s debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly double what it was a decade ago, but still quite low compared to other countries. For example, Switzerland’s government debt is 41% of GDP. The U.S. and Canadian governments’ debt is 133% and 106% of GDP, respectively. The U.K.’s debt is 98% of GDP. Bremner’s biggest concern is hotel overcapacity, which would ultimately suppress prices. “That luxury positioning is going to come under a little bit of erosion, because [the Saudis] are moving so quickly. With that level of supply, it is quite hard to balance,” she says, adding that Euromonitor International’s latest forecast model predicts that the average traveler’s spend will have already dropped by 2030. “Too many hotel rooms that aren’t being filled will drive prices down, so that’s a risk.” Sand Dollars: A new Four Seasons is a part of Red Sea Global and will have 149 rooms and suites, a spa and an 18-hole golf course. In addition, Saudi Arabia has a persistent PR problem among many would-be travelers, especially those from the West. The Kingdom still has strict laws about drinking and severe restrictions for women, not to mention allegations of human rights abuses and attacks against journalists. In 2021, the U.S.   Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the 2018 murder of   journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But any concerns about human rights haven’t stopped multinational corporations from investing in the Kingdom’s grand vision. “For some players, it will be a very important issue, perhaps a complete barrier to entry,” says Bremner. “However, we can see that the majority of luxury hotel brands have already shifted from China and the U.A.E. into Saudi Arabia.” After all, the international travel market loves nothing more than a shiny, new destination in an emerging market and right now, the Middle East is having a moment. “You have the Middle East in the sort of perfect location,” says Bremner, “just like Turkey—within a five-hour flight of Asia and of Western Europe.” Even with the start of the Israel-Hamas War last October, the Mideast was nevertheless the fastest-growing tourism region in 2023, with international arrivals 23% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the  . That’s 35% above the global average, as the rest of the world’s tourism is, on average, still at a 12 point deficit compared to 2019 visitor volume. While just over three million American tourists visited the region in 2023—making up 12.6% of total outbound U.S. tourists—that’s a massive 39% jump from 2019. And though the Middle East’s portion of American tourists was smaller than those of Europe (40%) and Asia (15.7%) last year, it was the only one of the three regions that has grown since the pandemic, according to data from National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO), the agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that tracks tourism statistics. But Freeman isn’t concerned about Saudi Arabia’s ability to lure large numbers of American tourists. “I'm worried about them trying to attract Europeans, high-spending Middle Easterners, and Asians, who might have otherwise come and spent their money in the United States,” he says. After all, Freeman says, international tourism is an increasingly competitive sport where one country’s gain is another’s loss: “What gives us pause,” he says, “is that other nations now realize that travel is a global competition to figure out who can attract the customer.”"

    "content": "President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary in South Carolina, a state that carried his path to the nomination in the 2020 presidential election—as his campaign hopes Saturday’s victory will re-energize Black voters who have strayed from the president, contributing to his sliding approval rating. President Joe Biden speaks at the Biden for President 2024 campaign headquarters Saturday in  The Associated Press called the race for Biden at 7:23 p.m.—just 23 minutes after the polls closed Saturday—with Biden having more than 95% support. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson each had less than 2% of the vote. Biden was widely expected to win the South Carolina primary and is the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. South Carolina kicked off the Democratic nominating contest after the Democratic National Committee moved the state ahead of New Hampshire and Iowa on the official primary calendar—a symbolic reward to its Democratic voters who delivered Biden a resounding victory in the state in the 2020 presidential nomination, when all 46 counties voted for him. South Carolina, where early voting kicked off Jan. 22, will award 55 delegates of the 1,991 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. “The truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact,” Biden told an audience at an event in Columbia, South Carolina last month. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.” 19. That’s the number of percentage points Biden’s support among Black voters declined last year, according to a November NBC   that found his approval rating had dipped to 40% among all voters, the lowest level of his presidency. It currently stands at 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s   The Biden campaign hopes his win in South Carolina, where about 60% of Democratic voters are Black, will mobilize the key demographic in subsequent primaries and the general election. Biden is likely to face former President Donald Trump in a historic rematch in the November general election as Trump appears poised to clinch the Republican nomination after winning both the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. Biden has ratcheted up his attacks on Trump since he officially began campaigning at the start of the year, centering his talking points around contrasting himself with the former president, rather than highlighting his own record. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, repeatedly called him a “loser” over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and regularly reminds voters Trump appointed Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump and his Republican allies, meanwhile, accuse Biden of corruption, alleging he has improperly meddled in his son Hunter Biden and other family members’ business dealings. Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail largely surrounds his own four criminal indictments and accusing the prosecutors, without evidence, of bringing the cases in an effort to boost Biden’s reelection chances. Their rematch is expected to be a close contest, as polls show Trump leads Biden by less than two points, according to Real Clear Politics’  The next Democratic primary is Thursday in Nevada. Republicans will hold their primary the same day. No delegates will be awarded in the GOP contest and instead will go to the winner of the caucuses on Feb. 8 thanks to a new law that effectively split the state’s primary and caucuses into two separate events on different days. Trump is running in the caucuses, while former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is running in the primary. New Hampshire held its Democratic primary on Jan. 23, but the contest was unsanctioned and no delegates were awarded following a feud between the state and national Democratic parties. In protest of the new calendar, state Democrats opted to hold the primary on the same day as the GOP. Biden sided with the Democratic National Committee and did not appear on the ballot, but beat Phillips and Williamson anyway, winning 64% of votes following a successful write-in campaign."

Optical microscope view of Candida auris. The Seattle and King County public health department   Tuesday it identified three confirmed cases of Candida auris infection last week, after an initial case was confirmed on January 10. Candida auris is a type of fungus that grows as yeast, and though it’s rare, it can cause severe illness and spread easily because it’s typically resistant to antifungal medications,   to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All four people were patients of Kindred Hospital Seattle, and the first confirmed case was detected through a “proactive screening program” during admission to the hospital, according to the news release from King County officials. The other three patients initially tested negative for the fungus when they were first admitted, though additional testing revealed they were positive, suggesting they were infected during their stay at the hospital. Local officials still haven’t identified the source of the outbreak, but they’re working with Kindred Hospital to keep transmissions down by keeping infected patients isolated, and notifying facilities that admit patients who were previously at Kindred. The CDC issued a   in May 2023 about an uptick of Candida auris cases spreading in healthcare facilities, labeling it an “urgent antimicrobial resistant threat.” 2,377. That’s how many Candida auris infections were reported in the U.S. in 2022—the year with the most up-to-date data—  to the CDC. Some 5,754 other people were found to have Candida auris somewhere on their body that same year, though they weren’t sick or had an active infection. Candida auris was first identified in Japan in  , where it was spotted in a patient’s ear secretion. The U.S. first began tracking infections in 2016, and it was discovered that cases dated back to 2013 in the country. Cases have since grown every year and have been reported in 36 states as of 2022, with the most drastic increase occurring during the Covid pandemic between 2020 and 2021, where the U.S. saw a 94% increase, according to CDC  . Around 95% of cases occurred in five states between 2013 and 2020: New York (41%), Illinois (26%), New Jersey (14%), California (8%) and Florida (7%). Around   of Candida auris strains are resistant to at least one antifungal, while 30% are resistant to at least two. Part of the reason the infection spreads so quickly is because it’s often   as a different fungus and not treated properly, and spreads easily through healthcare facilities. This is because the infection can live on surfaces for at least two weeks, according to a 2017   published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. In comparison to Covid, the coronavirus can survive on surfaces for up to  , researchers from the National Institute of Health found. Candida auris can   severe infection and hospitalization in some patients. It’s particularly deadly in healthcare patients with serious medical issues, as   people with an invasive Candida auris infection—which affects places like the heart, brain and blood—die. The fungus can cause infection in different parts of the body like an open wound or the lungs, the CDC  , though bloodstream infection is the most common. There’s not a specific set of symptoms, as it has similar symptoms to other fungal infections.   of fungal infections include fever, chills, soreness, rashes, low blood pressure, muscle aches, shortness of breath, a cough, joint pain, pain while eating, fatigue, headache or discolored, brittle nails.

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

    "title": "DOD Confirms: Taylor Swift Is Not A Pentagon Asset (And Travis Kelce Probably Isn’t, Either)",
    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. \"I mean I like her music, she's all right. But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

    "title": "Trump Calls Central Bank Digital Currency ‘Very Dangerous’—After Vowing To Prohibit Fed’s ‘Digital Dollar’",
    "content": "Former President Donald Trump expressed heavy skepticism about the security of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which he has vowed to block, in an interview released Friday, though he personally owns   in cryptocurrency himself, according to Forbes’ estimate, and hawks a line of NFT trading cards. Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks after  Trump said a so-called “digital dollar” would be “very dangerous,” claiming it could create a situation where money suddenly disappears from people’s bank accounts, he told Fox News in response to a question about his plans to block the Federal Reserve from formally issuing a digital currency. The statements echo a similar claim Trump made in New Hampshire last month, where he told a crowd he would “never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency,” calling it a “dangerous threat to freedom.” While Trump has his own personal investments in digital currency, he was critical of the industry during his presidency, calling it “highly volatile,” though Republicans’ have proposed crypto-friendly regulations and Trump, if re-elected, is likely appoint regulators who would be more aligned with digital asset firms than the Biden administration, which is largely skeptical of the industry. The Federal Reserve has not expressed a definitive stance on digital currency, but has been exploring the possibility amid the explosion of private crypto and concerns that it could morph into an unregulated currency system outside of the federal government’s purview. Trump pivoted to artificial intelligence in responding to the question about digital currency in the interview, calling AI “maybe the most dangerous thing out there of anything, because there is no real solution,” he said in a preview of the interview, set to be released in full on Sunday. “The AI as they call it . . . is so scary,” he said, referencing a fake speech he recently saw of himself promoting a product he “never endorsed.” Trump, in his New Hampshire speech, likened the creation of a central bank digital currency to a form of “government tyranny,” warning it would give the federal government the ability to “take your money.” The Biden Administration issued a 2022 executive order that ordered government agencies to develop policy recommendations and a potential framework for regulating digital assets. The process for developing a central bank digital currency could take years, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last year, emphasizing that it has not made a decision on its feasibility and is still assessing the public’s appetite for such a system, which would require approval from Congress and the executive branch, Powell said. In his New Hampshire speech, Trump credited his former opponent, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for warning him of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency. Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after the Iowa primary and endorsed Trump, is among the names being floated as Trump’s potential running mate pick, as he is all-but-certain to clinch the GOP nomination, potentially as soon as March. Ramaswamy has also said a central bank digital currency would create “a mechanism for the government to be able to wipe out your bank account, wipe out your dollars if you say or do something the government disapproves of” calling it “a threat to liberty in this country.” Eleven countries have established a central bank currency, citing plummeting cash usage, increased accessibility, lower infrastructure costs and improved security. More than 100 countries are currently exploring the option."

Full-year operating profit also exceeded analysts’ expectations, climbing 44% at constant exchange rates to $15 billion. Diluted earnings per share rose 52% to 18.61 Danish kroner ($2.7). Around 90% of the drugmaker's overall sales—$31.2 billion—came from its obesity and diabetes care division, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively authorized to treat diabetes and obesity. Sales of GLP-1 diabetes medications—a class that includes Ozempic—and in obesity care were largely responsible for this uptick, Novo Nordisk said, rising 52% and 154% at constant exchange rates, respectively. Novo Nordisk shares rose around 4% during early trading on Wednesday morning. \"We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. “Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.\" The stellar success of Ozempic and Wegovy—both branded drugs containing the same active ingredient, semaglutide—has rapidly propelled Novo Nordisk into a rarified club of extraordinarily valuable companies and triggered an acknowledged   for a company of its size. It now has a market value of around $480 billion, up from around $310 billion at the start of 2023, $250 billion at the start of 2022 and around $160 billion at the start of 2021.

Semaglutide mimics the action of a hormone—GLP-1—that is responsible for regulating appetite and blood sugar. It has been shown to help facilitate weight loss and studies suggest it could bestow other health benefits in areas like heart and kidney disease as well. While it is far from the first drug shown to reduce weight, it does not appear to be accompanied by the same litany of often serious side effects as previous generations of weight loss drugs. Experts have therefore hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity, one of our era’s most pressing public health problems. For several years, Novo Nordisk has been the sole provider of GLP-1 generation of weight loss drugs and it has heavily struggled to meet booming demand. It was recently   by Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound injections—a branded name for tirzepatide, the same ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro—are also expected to become bestsellers.

Jones submitted a report to the court on Friday,   that while the defendants in the case “have been cooperative” with her oversight, she’s identified “deficiencies” in materials she’s reviewed, “including disclosures that are either incomplete, present results inconsistently, and/or contain errors,” and which reflect “reflect a lack of effective governance” at the company. Trump attorney Clifford S. Robert responded to Jones’ report in a   to the court Monday, accusing her of overstating minor issues and “twist[ing]  immaterial accounting items into a narrative favoring her continued appointment, and thereby the continued receipt of millions of dollars in excessive fees.” Jones’ letter also gained attention for noting in a footnote that while Trump recorded a $48 million loan for his  , the Trump Organization told her such a loan “never existed”—a disclosure legal experts told   could get the ex-president into legal trouble, either for making a false entry on his financial disclosures, or for tax evasion, if he were found to have invented a loan to avoid income taxes. Robert called Jones’ claim about the Chicago loan a “demonstrable falsehood” and a “deliberate mischaracterization” in his letter to the court, claiming the Trump Organization never told Jones that the loan didn’t exist, but rather just that “no liabilities or obligations are outstanding” under the loan. Jones’ criticisms about the Trump Organization’s financials come as Judge Arthur Engoron prepares to announce a verdict as soon as this week in the ongoing fraud case against Trump and his company, so anything suggesting the Trump Organization is improperly managing their finances could influence the judge as he decides what penalties the defendants should face. Engoron is set to issue a verdict in the   as soon as this week, as he said he aimed to come out with his decision by the end of January. The judge has already found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud by misstating valuations, but he still has to determine whether they’re liable for other infractions—like insurance fraud and falsifying records—and whether the fraud was done intentionally. James has asked Engoron to impose a  , including a $370 million fine and barring Trump from New York’s real estate industry, but the verdict will also likely determine Jones’ fate as the company’s monitor. James has asked Engoron to extend Jones’ term as monitor for at least five years, while Robert opposed that on Monday. “Further oversight is unwarranted and will only unjustly enrich the Monitor as she engages in some ‘Javert’ like quest against the Defendants,” Robert told the court, referring to the antagonist in the book and musical “Les Miserables.” James has accused Trump and his business associates—including his sons—of fraudulently misstating the value of their assets on financial statements more than 200 times between 2011 and 2021. The attorney general’s office alleges the ex-president and his colleagues did so knowingly in order to obtain more favorable business deals and reflect a higher net worth for Trump. While the case went to trial starting in October, Engoron appointed the independent monitor a year earlier, soon after James’ lawsuit was filed, and Jones previously filed a   in November saying the Trump Organization made $40 million in transfers without informing her. In her letter to the court Friday, Jones accused Trump and his co-defendants of a series of issues that included minor math errors, falsely claiming the Trump family owned something that was actually controlled by Trump’s trust, calculating values differently from document to document and failing to include some required information in financial documents. The monitor also noted the company’s projected income and expenses for its property at 40 Wall Street for 2023 were “materially different” from its actual income and expenses the previous year. Trump’s loan in Chicago has been a mystery for years. The then-candidate recorded an “over $50 million loan” against the Chicago tower on his financial disclosure in 2015, which he said he owed to Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC—a company that he himself owns. Forbes   in 2020 that financial records show Trump doesn’t actually seem to pay any interest on the loan, however, and lists Chicago Unit Acquisition LLC as having no value, which is confusing given that it should theoretically have more than $50 million in value if it’s issued a $50 million loan. “There should be an offsetting entry somewhere,” Harvard real estate professor Richard Peiser told Forbes at the time. “I can’t explain that.” Jones is the latest person involved with the civil fraud case to draw Trump and his associates’ ire, as the ex-president has attacked the case against him as a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Trump has already repeatedly attacked Engoron, James and Engoron’s clerk in the fraud trial, resulting in a gag order being imposed on him that barred him from speaking publicly about court staff—and led to him facing $15,000 in fines.

    "title": "Ozempic Maker Novo Nordisk Beats Profit Forecasts As Weight-Loss Sales Soar",
    "content": "Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings for 2023, propelled by a tsunami of demand for its blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs as new treatments emerge and compete for a slice of the growing market. Sales of Wegovy, an injectable prescription weight loss medicine, has helped boost profits for Novo  Novo Nordisk reported $33.7 billion of sales for 2023, an increase of 36% at constant exchange rates and beating analysts’ expectations. Full-year operating profit also exceeded analysts’ expectations, climbing 44% at constant exchange rates to $15 billion. Diluted earnings per share rose 52% to 18.61 Danish kroner ($2.7). Around 90% of the drugmaker's overall sales—$31.2 billion—came from its obesity and diabetes care division, which includes Ozempic and Wegovy, respectively authorized to treat diabetes and obesity. Sales of GLP-1 diabetes medications—a class that includes Ozempic—and in obesity care were largely responsible for this uptick, Novo Nordisk said, rising 52% and 154% at constant exchange rates, respectively. Novo Nordisk shares rose around 4% during early trading on Wednesday morning. \"We are very pleased with the strong performance in 2023 reflecting that more than 40 million people are now benefiting from our innovative diabetes and obesity treatments,” said CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. “Our focus in 2024 will be on reaching more patients, progressing and expanding our pipeline as well as the continued significant expansion of our production capacity.\" The stellar success of Ozempic and Wegovy—both branded drugs containing the same active ingredient, semaglutide—has rapidly propelled Novo Nordisk into a rarified club of extraordinarily valuable companies and triggered an acknowledged   for a company of its size. It now has a market value of around $480 billion, up from around $310 billion at the start of 2023, $250 billion at the start of 2022 and around $160 billion at the start of 2021. With such fast growth, Novo Nordisk recently dethroned French luxury goods firm LVMH as Europe’s most valuable public company and its market value is larger than the annual economic output of its home country, Denmark. Officials there are  over the country’s reliance on a single firm and   into the same trap as Finland when it hitched its wagon to erstwhile phone giant  . Semaglutide mimics the action of a hormone—GLP-1—that is responsible for regulating appetite and blood sugar. It has been shown to help facilitate weight loss and studies suggest it could bestow other health benefits in areas like heart and kidney disease as well. While it is far from the first drug shown to reduce weight, it does not appear to be accompanied by the same litany of often serious side effects as previous generations of weight loss drugs. Experts have therefore hailed it as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity, one of our era’s most pressing public health problems. For several years, Novo Nordisk has been the sole provider of GLP-1 generation of weight loss drugs and it has heavily struggled to meet booming demand. It was recently   by Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound injections—a branded name for tirzepatide, the same ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro—are also expected to become bestsellers. Analysts believe the anti-obesity market could become one of the most lucrative opportunities for the pharmaceutical sector in its history and could   be worth as much as $100 billion by the end of the decade and   much more. Adjacent industries like wellness,  , and fitness are reportedly   the popularity of weight loss drugs will eat into revenues. Novo Nordisk said it expects solid growth for the year ahead as well, with sales expected to climb as much as 26% and operating profit as much as 29% at constant exchange rates.  (FT)"

The stock drop came after part of a 737 MAX 9 jet blew open on a Friday evening Alaska Airlines flight, causing an emergency landing and   the latest high-profile safety concern involving Boeing aircraft. Boeing stock’s slide caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue chip stocks including Boeing, to open at its lowest level since mid-December.

Both parents face involuntary manslaughter charges after not providing their son—who fatally shot  Jennifer   during cross-examination that while she and her husband James “didn’t just hand him a gun as ‘here you go, son,’” the weapon was intended to be used when they went to the gun range “as a family.” School employees were also not notified that their son owned or had access to a gun because Jennifer “didn’t think it was relevant,” despite a meeting on the morning of the shooting in which school officials indicated they were concerned about their son’s mental health. Jennifer   Thursday she “didn’t feel comfortable” being in charge of the gun, which she and James bought as a Christmas gift, later adding James was responsible for keeping the gun locked away. Though James was “entrusted” to store the gun, Jennifer claimed it was “pretty clear you didn’t trust James with much” because he had issues holding a job or handling his money. Their son also never asked for help with mental health issues, Jennifer said, adding he would sometimes have anxiety after taking tests at school and they believed he was “messing around” when he told his parents he was seeing demons in their home. Both Jennifer and James have pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Closing arguments in Jennifer’s case will be held later on Friday. James is expected to stand trial next month. Jennifer, 45, and James, 47, were arrested months after their son Ethan fatally shot four students and wounded seven others at Oxford High School in 2021. Prosecutors   both parents failed to prevent access to the 9mm Sig Sauer handgun used in the attack, suggesting the gun was left unsecured in a drawer in the parents’ bedroom. On the morning of the shooting, the school called both parents after a teacher found a note on Ethan’s desk that said, “the thoughts won’t stop, help me,” with drawings of a handgun nearby.   from Ethan’s journals also indicated his “parents won’t listen to me about help or a therapist” and expressed his desire to “shoot up” his school.

    "content": "Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade confirmed a “personal relationship” with District Attorney Fani Willis for the first time Friday, as Willis fights a push by former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants to have Willis thrown off the Georgia election interference case over the allegations. ulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appears before Judge Scott McAfee for a hearing in the  Wade acknowledged he and Willis “developed a personal relationship” in 2022, after he was appointed special prosecutor, in an affidavit filed Friday as part of Willis’ response to Trump and his co-defendants’ motion to have Willis disqualified from the case. Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

Those concerned about Swift’s arrival in Las Vegas “can be Fearless” knowing she can “wow Japanese audiences” before she returns to the U.S. to support the Chiefs while “wearing Red,” the embassy said. FlightAware spokesperson Kathleen Bangs told   Swift making it to the Super Bowl is “certainly doable,” adding she could probably make it to Las Vegas within 10 hours because Tokyo’s time zone is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas—giving her more than a full day to jet from Tokyo to Sin City.

Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade, has been accused of having an improper relationship  Willis hired Wade in 2022 to prosecute the criminal case against Trump and 18 co-defendants on charges of racketeering, violation of oath by a public officer and conspiracy to impersonate a public officer over Trump’s alleged scheme to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden—Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. Since his hiring, however, Wade has faced accusations that his experience did not qualify him for the lead prosecutor position in the Trump case, with Trump co-defendant Michael Roman arguing in a lawsuit against Willis that Wade’s “lack of experience” does not meet Fulton County standards “given the complexity of the charges.” Before joining the prosecution in Fulton County, Wade worked as a prosecutor and later as a judge in suburban Cobb County handling low-level criminal cases, the   reported, citing “scant evidence” of his record prosecuting major cases and no evidence of his work on a major political corruption case similar to the one Trump faces in Georgia. Wade’s record as a prosecutor primarily involves criminal defense and personal injury cases,     reported, while his law firm,  , lauds him as a “zealous advocate” with experience representing clients after major car accidents and contract disputes. Wade, who graduated from John Marshall Law School in Chicago (now part of the University of Illinois at Chicago), has also served as an assistant county solicitor—a position that handles misdemeanor cases—and   on three occasions for a seat on the bench of the Cobb County Superior Court between 2012 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2021, Wade served as an associate municipal judge in Marietta, Georgia—just north of Atlanta—becoming the first Black man to serve as a municipal judge in the Atlanta suburb. Since his hiring on the Trump case, Wade has faced criticism from multiple co-defendants, including four defendants who requested a “sanction” against Wade, including his potential “disqualification,” after Wade’s law office sent an unsolicited brochure depicting his smiling face and an advertisement for legal services to multiple defendants just weeks after their indictment in the case, the   reported. Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the election interference case,   requests for punishment, finding the brochure was not sent intentionally, while admitting it was “embarrassing” for prosecutors. An attorney for Trump co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro also   Wade did not file the necessary oath of office to join the prosecution in a bid to dismiss Wade from the case—McAfee   that argument, saying the oath requirements do not apply to contractors on a single case. Nearly $654,000. That’s how much Wade has been paid by the Fulton County District Attorney’s office since January 2022, according to Fulton County  . Nathan Wade was thrown into the national spotlight in the midst of two cases involving his estranged marriage with Joycelyn Wade. The saga began last month when Roman filed a   seeking to disqualify Willis from prosecuting the election interference case on the grounds that her “improper, clandestine personal relationship” with Wade constituted a conflict of interest and violated public money laws, with Wade receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay. Bank records also revealed Wade and Willis went on at least two vacations together: one to the Caribbean and one to Napa Valley, California. In Roman’s suit, the Trump co-defendant cited sources close to the matter, as well as Wade’s ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife. The same day Roman filed his complaint, attorneys representing Joycelyn Wade   Willis in the divorce proceedings, with Willis set to testify at a hearing on Wednesday. That hearing, however, was abruptly canceled when Nathan and Joycelyn Wade agreed to a   to resolve their divorce. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee   Willis as part of a separate investigation into allegations her office planned to misuse a federal grant from the Department of Justice earmarked for a youth empowerment program. In a court filing on Friday, committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) argued Willis’ office planned to use nearly $500,000 in federal funding from the grant on “frivolous, unrelated expenses,” including on MacBooks and travel costs—Willis denied the allegations. Jordan also accused Willis of firing a whistleblower who reportedly attempted to prevent the funds from being misused—Willis claimed the staffer was “terminated for cause.” After two weeks of accusations, Wade broke his silence Friday morning,   to having a “personal relationship” with Willis in an affidavit filed in Fulton County Superior Court, though he denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with the district attorney. Wade also argued he had “no financial interest” in Trump’s election interference case, and stressed that no income he received as special prosecutor was “shared with or provided to” Willis. Wade’s affidavit was included in a 176-page court filing Willis submitted Friday morning, in which the district attorney rejected Trump’s request for her to be removed from the case, reiterating her argument that the case for her dismissal has no legal merit. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on whether to dismiss Willis from the case. Trump, who has repeatedly targeted Willis throughout his election interference case,   Willis once again in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, claiming she was “able to get her ‘lover’ much more money, almost a Million Dollars, than she would be able to get for the prosecution of any other person or individual,” by bringing charges against Trump.

    "title": "Taylor Swift At The Super Bowl: The Conspiracy Theory, Explained",
    "content": "Gamed: Right-wing influencers believe that Travis Kelce—and by extension Taylor Swift—reached the  At some point, Taylor Swift transcended into one of those celebrities who isn’t just famous, but scarily famous; she’s not a brand, she’s an industry. Swift’s extraordinary level of fame, success and influence has provoked the suspicions of reactionary influencers and conspiracy theorists. In conspiratorial online spaces, nothing ever just happens — big things are planned, and Swift’s boyfriend is going to the Super Bowl. Swift is currently dating football star Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, inspiring her fans to take a keen interest in the NFL. Swift attending her boyfriend's games   of conservative commentators who believe that Swift’s media buzz is distracting from the sport. More recently, it has lead some to believe that her presence is part of a convoluted political plot. Swift has been frequently and heavily criticized by conservative commentators ever since the singer spoke up in support of abortion-rights and accused former President Donald Trump of \"stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism\"   (Twitter). Last year, Sean Davis, CEO and co-founder of conservative web magazine The Federalist wrote \"Taylor Swift is dumb and her music sucks\" on an X post that linked to   titled “Taylor Swift’s Popularity Is A Sign Of Societal Decline.” Political commentator Tomi Lahren gave Swift a backhanded compliment on her podcast, stating: \"Her lefty, liberal braindead political opinions aside, I am a fan of Taylor Swift and I have been since way before she went full liberal.\" Kelce previously sparked right-wing   after participating in an ad for Pfizer vaccines; conservative pundit Charlie Kirk   Kelce should be “shamed and humiliated,” while conservative influencers the Hodgetwins   that the NFL star had “sold his soul to Pfizer.” Conspiracy theorists were emboldened when Fox News   baselessly asserting that Taylor Swift is a Pentagon “psy-op” used for political messaging. Not long after, the Kansas City Chiefs secured their place in the Super Bowl following Sunday’s AFC victory, meaning Kelce’s game will likely be attended by Swift. Hence, right-wing influencers came to the conclusion that Swift’s presence at the Super Bowl is by design, with the intent to secure the election for Joe Biden through Swift’s high-profile endorsement at the winning game. The X account “EndWokeness” posted a picture of Swift on several magazine covers and wrote: “What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic and natural. It’s an op. We all feel it. We all know it.” Conservative influencer Benny Johnson used the same picture to emphasize the same point, in a reply to his own post asserting that the NFL was rigged. Johnson  : “Taylor Swift is an op. It’s all fake. You’re being played.” Former “anti-woke” presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy   a more complete version of the theory, prompting affirmations from other conservative commentators. Laura Loomer   that “the Democrats’ Taylor Swift election interference psyop is happening in the open… They are going to use Taylor Swift as the poster child for their pro-abortion GOTV Campaign.” Far-right conspiracy theorist Rogan O’Handley had the most dramatic take — O’Handley wrote a post to the San Francisco 49ers, begging them to beat the Kansas City Chiefs to prevent the death of “millions” and secure “the fate of the free world.” From an outsider’s perspective, Swift’s explosive rise to superstar might seem rather baffling — in some sense, Swift resembles MrBeast, a celebrity who has catapulted themselves to an unprecedented level of fame and influence through their carefully cultivated image, but doesn’t seem particularly charismatic to those outside the fandom. At Swift’s level of fame, the attention snowballs, with the media increasing coverage of Swift as she grows more popular, and fans obsessing over her every move. Not everyone will get Swift’s appeal, but the cumulative effect of her fame isn’t hard to understand — it’s just the market at work. Really, the conspiracy theory seems to have been forged in fear; it’s an acknowledgment that Taylor Swift’s voice holds power, possibly enough to sway the needle. Last year, an Instagram post from Swift encouraging her fans to vote sparked results — NPR   a whopping 1,226% increase in voter registrations the hour after she posted. The funny thing is, Swift is not a particularly outspoken celebrity when it comes to politics. \"Part of the fabric of being a country artist is don't force your politics on people,\" Swift explained in the 2020 documentary  . \"Let people live their lives. That is grilled into us.\" Years ago, Swift was very careful to keep her political opinions to herself (in fact, conservatives   she was secretly a Trump supporter). Like the majority of  , Swift leans liberal. In 2018, Swift was more politically outspoken, urging her fans to vote against Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who was running for Senate at the time. On Instagram, Swift cited Blackburn’s voting record as evidence that spoke for itself: \"[Blackburn] voted against equal pay for women,\" Swift wrote. “She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.\" Blackburn won that election, despite Swift speaking out against her. But Swift’s instinctual rejection of conservative culture war issues aligns with the views of her fans; Gen Z’s   and   is well-documented. Other than speaking out for abortion rights and calling on her fans to vote, Swift has not been politically active in the last couple of years. Swift did endorse President Joe Biden in 2020, and according to  , the Biden campaign is actively courting Swift’s endorsement again, and they’re open to suggestions — one idea was even to have President Biden make an appearance on Swift’s Eras Tour (hopefully, he won’t refer to Taylor as “Britney”  ). Rigging the Super Bowl, however, seems like a tremendous amount of effort to win that endorsement. The theory is especially absurd when one considers that the Taylor Swift conspiracy is mainly touted by influencers who believe the last election was rigged (if President Biden holds the power that conspiracy theorists believe he does, one wonders why they bother to vote at all). Swift might not endorse President Biden this time around — she might not even have time to make the Super Bowl. But for conservative influencers, Swift’s mere presence at the stadium seems threatening. Perhaps she reminds them that their culture war is a losing battle."

    "title": "Trump Has Racked Up Nearly $40 Million In Legal Fees Since His First Indictment",
    "content": "Trump’s criminal and civil cases cost him nearly $40 million in legal fees in the months since he was indicted for the first time in March 2023, according to filings from his leadership PAC Save America, as the ex-president used donor funds last year to battle cases that are only set to escalate before the 2024 election. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event on Jan. 27 in Las Vegas.  Trump’s leadership PAC Save America—which is paying the bulk of the ex-president’s legal fees—spent approximately $53 million between March 30, 2023, the date of Trump’s first  , and the end of 2023, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, with $38.9 million of that money   specifically on legal consulting and other legal-related services. That compares to $25.2 million that was   on legal consulting between Nov. 2020, when Trump first formed the PAC in the aftermath of the 2020 election, and March 29, 2023—with $8.4 million of that   during the first three months of 2023, right before the first charges against Trump were brought. Trump’s largest legal payments went to Christopher Kise, who represents Trump in his   and his criminal case for retaining White House documents, and Kise’s legal associates, with Save America paying Chris Kise & Associates $3.3 million and Continental PLLC, a law firm employing Kise and other lawyers representing Trump, $3.6 million between March 30 and December 31, 2023. Other attorneys representing Trump in his criminal cases were paid by Save America PAC, records show: Attorneys at Blanche Law, representing Trump in multiple criminal cases, earned $2.3 million; John Lauro, representing Trump in his federal election case, earned $2.6 million; Georgia election case attorney Steven Sadow took in $1.5 million and Susan Necheles, Trump’s lawyer in his Manhattan “hush money” case, earned $950,555, among other payments. Trump attorney  ’s firm Habba Madaio & Associates, which represents Trump in cases including his civil fraud trial and E. Jean Carroll’s defamation case against him, was paid $3.2 million, while Dhillon Law Group, representing Trump in 14th Amendment cases seeking to disqualify him from the ballot, took in $579,408 in payments through Save America and additional payments through Trump’s campaign. Save America’s legal-related fees also include other payments, such as more than $900,000 to NYU accounting professor  , who appeared as an expert witness at Trump’s civil fraud trial, and   in May to a vendor holding ex-attorney Rudy Giuliani’s electronic records, in order to help the former mayor pay his debts. Save America has $5.1 million   as it goes into 2024, when Trump is   criminal trials in potentially all four of the cases against him. He faces two federal trials, one for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining classified White House documents after leaving office, as well as a trial in Manhattan for “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign and a state case in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts. (The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.) Trump has also already faced a civil trial against writer E. Jean Carroll so far in 2024, as well as the end of the fraud trial against him and his company, and will go to the Supreme Court next week to challenge a Colorado ruling kicking him off the state’s ballot under the 14th Amendment. It won’t be known how much Trump has spent in 2024 so far until the PAC’s next filing with the FEC later this year. Save America raised $52.3 million in 2023, according to its FEC  , with most money coming from either small-money donors or transfers made from Trump’s Make America Great Again PAC and the Trump campaign. Online donors to Trump’s campaign are told 10% of their donation will go toward Save America. Hotel magnate Robert Bigelow—who previously made a $20 million   to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ now-terminated campaign—told   Tuesday he donated $1 million to cover Trump’s legal fees “a few weeks ago.” The New York Times   it’s unclear where that money is actually going, however, given limits on PAC donations that only allow sums of up to $5,000. That means Bigelow couldn’t simply donate $1 million to Save America, the Times notes, and the donor and Trump campaign haven’t offered any clarity on where the funds are being directed. Campaign finance experts told Forbes that Trump using PAC money to pay his personal legal fees is a “highly questionable” legal gray area, though one that Trump can likely get away with. While campaign money isn’t allowed to be spent on personal expenses, the FEC has ruled that doesn’t apply to leadership PACs like Save America. But Dan Weiner, former FEC counsel and director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Elections and Government Program, told Forbes that paying Trump’s legal fees could still constitute an illegal contribution to Trump’s campaign, although Weiner noted the FEC “does not have a history of aggressively enforcing the law when there’s any sort of gray area,” and the Justice Department is unlikely to prosecute unless there’s evidence Trump knew the spending was illegal. “Because of lax enforcement, we have this kind of ‘Wild West’ campaign finance landscape, where there are a bunch of rules, but they are so unevenly enforced that people don’t have a good sense of what they can and can’t do, and that’s obviously a breeding ground for pushing the envelope,” Weiner said. Trump’s remaining rival in the GOP primary election, Nikki Haley, has pointed to the ex-president’s ballooning legal fees to attack him as a candidate. Trump “can’t beat Joe Biden if he’s spending all his time and money on court cases and chaos,” Haley   Tuesday, after the New York Times   on Save America’s legal spending prior to the FEC report being filed. On top of his payments to lawyers, Trump also faces the growing issue of having to pay out high-dollar amounts in his civil cases. A jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll   for defaming her on Friday, and New York state Judge Arthur Engoron is set to issue a verdict in the coming days in Trump’s fraud trial, which   in him having to pay up to $370 million plus interest. The payments could take a significant hit on  , as Forbes   the ex-president had $426 million in cash and liquid assets as of September. While Save America’s $5 million in cash means it couldn’t meaningfully help pay off those debts, it remains to be seen if Trump will try to use any part of his campaign funds on the damages awards, or try to raise funds through his PAC in order to pay them. “I don’t think it’s legal for the PAC to pay the damages award, but I worry that his lawyers will take the position that it can,” Weiner told Forbes. “There’s enough gray area that they might feel they have enough legal coverage to proceed.”  (Forbes)  (Forbes)  (Forbes)"

Meta stock jumped more than 20% to a new record closing share price of $474.99 on Friday, notching its largest single-day gain since July 2013 as investors digested the social media company’s Thursday afternoon earnings report featuring revenue and profit beats and debuting the company’s first-ever cash dividend payments to shareholders.

    "content": "The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani Willis on Friday, over allegations Willis’ office planned to misuse federal funds and fired a whistleblower—as the Fulton County prosecutor faces scrutiny after bringing racketeering charges against former President Donald Trump. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the   demanding documents from Willis’ office, citing a whistleblower allegation that Willis’ office “planned to use” a nearly $500,000 federal grant earmarked for a youth empowerment and gang prevention program to instead “cover frivolous, unrelated expenses.” The allegations are unrelated to Willis’ criminal case against Trump, which accuses the former president of illegally trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Jordan claimed in a letter to Willis that the district attorney failed to comply with multiple House committee requests for documents on her use of federal grant money, though Willis’ office has   those, arguing in a letter last fall that the requests are an unconstitutional “Attempt to Interfere” with state criminal cases. The subpoena comes as Willis faces allegations she used federal grant funding for MacBooks, other “swag” and “travel,” and that her office fired an employee who had attempted to prevent the office from allegedly misusing federal grant funding, the right-wing   reported. Willis criticized the allegations against her as “false,” claiming the employee was “terminated for cause” and that the grant funding has been “focused on helping at-risk youth and seeking justice for sexual assault victims.” Willis has been ensnared in a separate divorce case involving one of her lead Trump prosecutors for several weeks, as well as in a case brought by one of Trump’s 18 co-defendants accusing her of violating conflict of interest laws. In a court filing last month, Trump co-defendant Mike Roman alleged Willis violated ethical standards by engaging in a clandestine relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to the Trump case.   presented in the divorce case revealed Wade and Willis took trips together to the Caribbean and Napa Valley in 2022 and 2023, which Wade paid for. Willis has not denied the relationship with Wade, though she has rebuffed a separate subpoena in the divorce case,   in a court filing that Wade’s wife, Joycelyn Wade, had been “obstructing and interfering” with Trump’s RICO case in an attempt to damage her reputation. Willis reportedly plans to argue she has not broken any laws requiring her to step down from the case, sources told   on Thursday. Willis was   earlier this week to testify at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on whether she should be removed from the racketeering case for allegedly violating conflict of interest laws.

    "title": "Biden Calls Trump A ‘Loser’ In South Carolina Speech",
    "content": "President Joe Biden referred to former President Donald Trump as a “loser” during a campaign speech in Charleston Monday, the second time in a matter of days Biden has ramped up his attacks against Trump as the 2024 presidential race builds steam. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event at Emanuel AME Church on January 8, 2024 in  Biden, speaking about the 2020 presidential election, said “losers are taught to concede when they lose, and he’s a loser,” he said from Mother Emanuel AME Church, a historic Black church where a white supremacist killed nine worshippers in a mass shooting in 2015. Biden also pointed to the dozens of failed GOP-backed legal challenges to the election results, and accused election deniers of not having “respect for the 81 million people who voted” for him. The statements follow similar criticism of Trump during a rally in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on Friday to mark the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, where Biden slammed Trump for attempting to “steal history” by contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election and rebuked him for   used by Adolf Hitler to describe immigrants. Biden’s speech Monday was also interrupted by protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, to which Biden responded that he is urging the Israeli government to scale back its attacks in Gaza. “In their world, all these Americans, including you, don’t count,” Biden said Monday. “But that’s not the real world. That’s not democracy. That’s not America. In America, we all count.” The 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close rematch between Trump and Biden, who trails the former president in polls by 2 points, according to RealClearPolitics  . Biden’s approval rating stands at 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight’s  , and surveys increasingly show voters lack confidence in him to manage the economy and the Israel-Hamas war. His speech in South Carolina comes as he has struggled to retain support from Black voters and other key demographics. While South Carolina’s Feb. 3 Democratic primary is not competitive, it could serve as a testing ground for Biden’s ability to mobilize Black voters who helped propel him to win the White House in 2020. How a criminal conviction could impact Trump’s chances of winning the 2024 election and his slight lead over Biden in polls. While none of his four criminal cases, encompassing 91 total charges, are expected to conclude before the primaries are over, all of his cases, plus several civil suits, are scheduled to go to trial before the November general election. In addition, the Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling on whether Trump will be allowed to remain on the ballot in Maine and Colorado after both states decided he should be removed from their ballots under a 14th Amendment provision that prohibits elected officials who engaged in an insurrection from running for office again."

    "content": "Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade confirmed a “personal relationship” with District Attorney Fani Willis for the first time Friday, as Willis fights a push by former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants to have Willis thrown off the Georgia election interference case over the allegations. ulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appears before Judge Scott McAfee for a hearing in the  Wade acknowledged he and Willis “developed a personal relationship” in 2022, after he was appointed special prosecutor, in an affidavit filed Friday as part of Willis’ response to Trump and his co-defendants’ motion to have Willis disqualified from the case. Wade emphasized a financial separation from Willis and argued neither of them financially benefit from the case against Trump, as some Trump allies have argued, telling Judge Scott McAfee he has never lived with Willis or shared a joint account, and the two have split travel expenses. Willis also rejected Trump and his co-defendants’ request to remove her from the case, arguing they have no legal merit and marking her most significant public response to the allegations. Willis wrote that she has no financial or personal conflicts of interest that justify her disqualification, calling the attacks on Wade’s qualifications “factually inaccurate, unsupported, and malicious.” Trump, who is charged with 13 felonies in the racketeering case, accused Willis of appointing Wade to the role to “get her ‘lover’ more money, almost a Million Dollars,” calling the case a “scam” in a Truth Social post in response to the allegations. Willis’ office indicted Trump and 18 others in August, accusing them of illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state. In addition to racketeering, he is charged with solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, among other felonies. The affair allegations were first made public last month, when Trump’s co-defendant in the case, Mike Roman, accused Wade and Willis of a “clandestine” relationship that violated ethical standards and creates an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman argued Willis financially benefitted from the case by hiring Wade as an outside prosecutor and paying him a $250/hour rate for his work, alleging he used the money to pay for vacations for the two. The relationship was also a factor in Wade’s divorce, which was settled Tuesday, in filings that showed Wade paid for plane tickets for Willis to Miami and San Francisco. Until Friday, there was no direct, public evidence or acknowledgement from the two of an affair. Some legal experts have opined that the allegations could taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions, but have also expressed doubts that they merit Wade or Willis’ removal from the case. McAfee has scheduled a Feb. 15 hearing on the motion to dismiss Willis from the case. Roman’s attorney subpoenaed both Willis and Wade to testify. The GOP-led House Judiciary Committee also subpoenaed Willis Friday surrounding a separate set of allegations that she planned to misuse federal grant money. Committee chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Willis has refused to comply with multiple requests from the committee for documents related to the grant. She has rebuffed the requests, calling them an unconstitutional “attempt to interfere” in a state criminal matter and denying allegations her office planned to misuse the federal funds. Georgia Republicans are also conducting a state Senate investigation into Willis, and some have called for her to be impeached."

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee. Committee Chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) issued the   demanding documents from Willis’ office, citing a whistleblower allegation that Willis’ office “planned to use” a nearly $500,000 federal grant earmarked for a youth empowerment and gang prevention program to instead “cover frivolous, unrelated expenses.” The allegations are unrelated to Willis’ criminal case against Trump, which accuses the former president of illegally trying to reverse his 2020 election loss in Georgia. Jordan claimed in a letter to Willis that the district attorney failed to comply with multiple House committee requests for documents on her use of federal grant money, though Willis’ office has   those, arguing in a letter last fall that the requests are an unconstitutional “Attempt to Interfere” with state criminal cases. The subpoena comes as Willis faces allegations she used federal grant funding for MacBooks, other “swag” and “travel,” and that her office fired an employee who had attempted to prevent the office from allegedly misusing federal grant funding, the right-wing   reported. Willis criticized the allegations against her as “false,” claiming the employee was “terminated for cause” and that the grant funding has been “focused on helping at-risk youth and seeking justice for sexual assault victims.” Willis has been ensnared in a separate divorce case involving one of her lead Trump prosecutors for several weeks, as well as in a case brought by one of Trump’s 18 co-defendants accusing her of violating conflict of interest laws. In a court filing last month, Trump co-defendant Mike Roman alleged Willis violated ethical standards by engaging in a clandestine relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to the Trump case.   presented in the divorce case revealed Wade and Willis took trips together to the Caribbean and Napa Valley in 2022 and 2023, which Wade paid for. Willis has not denied the relationship with Wade, though she has rebuffed a separate subpoena in the divorce case,   in a court filing that Wade’s wife, Joycelyn Wade, had been “obstructing and interfering” with Trump’s RICO case in an attempt to damage her reputation. Willis reportedly plans to argue she has not broken any laws requiring her to step down from the case, sources told   on Thursday. Willis was   earlier this week to testify at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing on whether she should be removed from the racketeering case for allegedly violating conflict of interest laws.

Still, Willis has faced wide-ranging GOP backlash after she   against Trump, with Trump labeling the case a “witch hunt” and state Republican lawmakers calling to convene a legislative session last year to remove Willis from office—Republican Gov.

Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade settled a divorce case with his wife, meaning District  Cobb County Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson approved a temporary settlement on Tuesday, noting that Wade and his wife, Joycelyn Wade, will agree to the exact terms of the settlement outside of the court.

    "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s raft of criminal charges is likely to hurt him with swing voters in a general election if he’s convicted, a growing number of polls suggest—but with Election Day nearing and his federal election case now removed from the court’s calendar, it’s unclear how many of the four cases against Trump will wrap up before voters head to the polls. Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on January 16 in Atkinson, New Hampshire.  Trump faces criminal charges in  : two federal cases—one brought for trying to overturn the 2020 election and another for retaining White House documents after leaving office—plus state cases in Georgia for his post-2020 election efforts, and in New York for alleged “hush-money” payments made during his 2016 campaign. A   released Jan. 26 found only 29% of Americans would vote for a candidate who’s been charged with a felony—as Trump has been—and 23% would vote for someone who’s been convicted of a felony crime by a jury. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult   released Wednesday found 53% of voters in seven battleground states would not vote for Trump if he were found guilty of a crime—including 23% of Republicans—while 55% would not vote for him if he were sentenced to prison. In South Carolina, a Washington Post/Monmouth University   found 36% of GOP primary voters would want Trump to be replaced as the Republican nominee if he were convicted after winning the nomination, and only 62% would vote for Trump if he were convicted and remained on the ballot. Trump’s federal election trial, initially scheduled for March, was   the court’s calendar as Trump tries to have it thrown out, which resulted in the case being paused; an appeals court is still deciding how to rule on Trump’s motion, with the issue likely to go to the Supreme Court once they do. His classified documents case is also widely expected to be delayed past its scheduled May start date, as U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has said she’ll review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March and has already   several deadlines, and his Georgia election trial still does not have a trial date set. Trump’s Manhattan case is scheduled to go to trial starting March 26, which is expected to proceed on schedule. The former president faces   for falsifying business records, punishable by up to 136 years in prison, but legal experts believe it’s unlikely he’ll be sentenced to prison as a first-time offender. It’s also the least likely case to sway voters, with a recent Yahoo News/YouGov   finding 40% believe “paying hush money to a porn star” would make a candidate “unfit for the presidency,” versus more than 50% who say Trump would be unfit if convicted of the crimes he’s charged with in his other cases. Trump faces a greater likelihood of going to prison in other cases and could be sentenced to more than   in prison if he were convicted on all the charges against him and given the maximum sentence—although this is highly unlikely. As cases go to trial, Axios   Friday Trump is also expected to attend them in person, resulting in “political theatrics” as he uses the court appearances as excuses to rail against the charges. “Trump feels certain the more voters think this is a political pile-on, the better he'll do,” Axios reports, citing anonymous sources. How the 2024 election will turn out. Recent   show Trump neck-and-neck against President Joe Biden in a general election, with most giving Trump a narrow edge. That means even a small number of swing voters who are persuaded to change their vote by Trump being convicted could be enough to affect the results. Even if Trump were convicted, it still wouldn’t stop him becoming president if he won the election, as there’s nothing in the Constitution that bars convicted felons from doing so. It   how this unprecedented situation would move forward logistically, particularly if he had been sentenced to prison before the election, and if Trump could pardon himself from any federal convictions if he became president. If charges against Trump are pending or he’s in the middle of a trial if he becomes president, he could likely also appoint Justice Department officials who would be willing to drop the federal charges against him. Trump’s indictments have only helped his fundraising as his campaign saw its   single-day fundraising totals in 2023 on the days after he pleaded not guilty in Manhattan and Georgia. Financial reports analyzed by   show that enthusiasm is slowing down, however, with Trump’s court appearances toward the end of the year not really moving the needle on his fundraising, though it’s likely high-profile trials could revive his supporters’ donations. Trump is the first former president to be criminally indicted, with the first charges brought against him in March 2023 in Manhattan before federal and Georgia prosecutors followed suit. The ex-president has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him, and has decried the cases as partisan “witch hunts” designed to hurt his campaigns. The likelihood that most of Trump’s trials could be delayed comes as the ex-president and his attorneys have sought to slow-walk his cases going to trial, filing motions trying to drag out the proceedings and   trial dates that were years in the future. The Justice Department tried to have Trump’s motion to dismiss his federal election charges heard by the Supreme Court before the federal appeals court could rule—which could have kept the trial on schedule—but the court   to step in, and Trump’s lawyers opposed the request.

A judge on Monday ruled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis does not have to sit for a  Willis was   of having a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade earlier this month, when an attorney for one of Trump’s co-defendants, Michael Roman, filed paperwork seeking her—and Wade’s—disqualification from the case for violating conflict of interest laws and mishandling public money. Roman’s team   the two had an “improper, clandestine personal relationship” before the prosecution began that resulted in Wade being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money for his role as special prosecutor (the attorney cited unnamed sources close to Wade and Willis but didn’t provide concrete evidence). Roman’s attorney also   Wade isn’t qualified for the position Willis appointed him to, arguing he doesn’t have the appropriate background to try the case and hasn’t “prosecuted a single felony trial”—and the New York Times also   Wade’s experience was primarily in low-level criminal cases, and there was no evidence he worked on racketeering cases like the one that ensnared Roman and Trump. The same day the accusation against Willis and Wade was made, Willis was   by the lawyer of Joycelyn Wade, Nathan Wade’s wife, to testify in the couple’s divorce proceedings. Last week,   revealed in the Wades’ divorce case showed Willis and Nathan Wade had taken at least two trips together in 2022 and 2023 for which he paid, something Joycelyn’s team argued has “no reasonable explanation … apart from a romantic relationship.” Joycelyn Wade’s legal team is seeking to   Willis on allegations that she has “unique” information about Wade’s finances, which her lawyer argues are relevant in determining dissipation of assets and spousal support. On Monday, a Cobb County judge ruled to unseal the Wades’ divorce records—which could give insight into Nathan Wade alleged relationship with Willis—but ruled Willis doesn’t need to be deposed in the divorce case, yet,   to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson said it appeared that “Wade would be the first and best source of information on what his income has been and how he's been spending it,” ABC News  , adding he would wait to determine whether Willis has “unique personal knowledge” and has to testify until after Wade’s deposition, which is scheduled for next week. Neither Willis nor Nathan Wade have commented on the alleged relationship, but after Roman’s initial filing, a spokesperson for Willis   she would respond “through appropriate court filings.” After allegations first broke, Willis   Nathan Wade at a church service—though she didn’t name him—saying he was “a great friend and a great lawyer.” On Jan. 18, Willis   in which she accused Joycelyn Wade of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution” and trying to “annoy, embarrass and oppress” her. Willis added she shouldn’t have to testify because the Wades’ marriage is “irretrievably broken,” meaning no testimony from her would be “relevant to granting or denying the divorce.” Willis charged Roman, Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their efforts to block the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia in 2020. Trump faces 13 charges, including conspiracy to impersonate a public officer and a violation of Georgia’s racketeering and corrupt organizations (RICO) act—which all Trump co-defendants were charged with. Roman is accused of participating in a plot to appoint fake pro-Trump electors in Georgia. Wade was appointed by Willis to be a special prosecutor on the case, and had previously worked as a prosecutor and a judge, but had little experience prosecuting major criminal cases or cases around the state’s racketeering statute,   to the New York Times. Wade had been a “longtime friend and mentor” to Willis when she hired him, the Times  , and had become someone she could trust with a case as important as the Trump case. $654,000. That’s about how much Nathan Wade has earned in legal fees for his work on the Trump election case, the Journal-Constitution  . Wade was hired to work on the case in November 2021 and was set to be paid an hourly rate of $250,   to the New York Times. How the allegations impact the trial against Trump and his co-defendants. The judge overseeing the trial has   to respond to Roman’s allegations by early February, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 15. In the meantime, Trump has capitalized on the scandal,   on Truth Social on Jan. 19 that the “lovers” knew he didn’t do anything wrong but “saw Dollar Signs, Fancy Living, and Fame,” so they falsely indicted him. One unnamed Trump adviser told the   the situation was a “gift,” saying they can use the allegations to discredit the case and raise speculation and potentially extend a decision in the case. If Willis, Wade or the DA’s office as a whole are disqualified, the Washington Post   a statewide council of attorneys would be tasked with finding a new prosecutor, which could delay the case significantly. The accusations against Willis and Wade haven’t yet impacted their case against Trump, and some legal analysts don’t think the pair need to be removed—which Roman’s   requested. Three well-known attorneys and critics of Trump—Norm Eisen, Joyce Vance and Richard Painter—penned a piece in   that said a prosecutor can only be disqualified under Georgia law if there is a “conflict of interest” in which the conflicting loyalties could “prejudice the defendant” and lead to “an improper conviction.” Allegations of ethics violations that don’t have anything to do with the trial, the attorneys wrote, cannot be used to get attorneys removed from a case. That said, one of the authors, Eisen, told reporters over the weekend Wade should step aside as the controversy could overshadow and delay the case, the Washington Post  ."

    "content": "A spokesperson for the Department of Defense has clapped back at right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim the government is working with Taylor Swift, Time Magazine, the NFL and the Democratic Party to ensure the win of President Joe Biden this November over likely opponent Donald Trump, who reportedly claims he's \"more popular\" than the pop star, anyway. Taylor Swift at the 81st Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2024. Theories that Swift is part of a psychological operation carried out by the Pentagon have been circulating since Time named the pop star person of the year in December and have only intensified in the last week as some baselessly claim her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is part of a Democratic Party-led plan to support Biden’s campaign. Podcaster Mike Crispi on Sunday   the NFL \"rigged\" the Chiefs' conference championship win to spread \"DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA\" and said he anticipates Swift will appear on the field with Kelce during the Super Bowl halftime break to endorse Biden: \"It's all been an op since day one,\" Crispi  The Chiefs are the reigning Super Bowl champions and have appeared in six consecutive AFC Championship games—the first five before Kelce and Swift began dating.Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy then piled on,  , \"I wonder who's going to win the Super Bowl next month. And I wonder if there's a major presidential endorsement coming from an artificially culturally propped-up couple this fall.” On Friday, Department of Defense Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told Forbes: “Taylor Swift is not part of a DOD psychological operation. Period.” The comment from the Pentagon is the second time the department has shut down rumors about a behind-the-scenes partnership—Fox News anchor Jesse Watters last month   if Swift is “a front for a covert political agenda” and claimed she was part of a DOD “psyop” for combating misinformation online; Singh   the department would \"shake it off\" in regard to the conspiracy theory. Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. \"I mean I like her music, she's all right. But I mean, have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?\" Fox News host Jesse Watters   “Around four years ago, the Pentagon’s psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset.” Swift has rarely forayed into the political sphere but has on occasion made her opinion known. Swift   for the first time in 2018 when she spoke up ahead of the midterm elections to support two Democratic candidates running for the U.S. House and Senate, and she also endorsed Biden for president about a month before the 2020 election. She has   her fans to vote on several occasions, including   to her 270 million Instagram followers last September that was   with the registration of 35,000 new voters in a single day. A similar 2018 post to her then-112 million followers is  increased voter registration nationwide by 240,000 in the days that followed—102,000 of which came from people aged 18 to 29. While Swift has stayed out of the 2024 presidential election so far, Biden is reportedly gunning for her support. A  report earlier this week said the Biden campaign is hoping to gain her financial support and leverage her popularity to increase young voter turnout. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California earlier this election cycle   Swift's political influence \"profoundly powerful.” 18%. That's the percentage of voters who say they are \"more likely\" or \"significantly more likely\" to vote for a candidate Swift endorses, according to a Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll conducted for  Rolling Stone   reported that despite Swift's stay-out-of-it approach so far, the chance she could endorse Biden again this fall has Republican strategists shaken up. An unnamed \"source with knowledge of the matter\"   told Rolling Stone that GOP front-runner Trump has claimed privately that he's \"more popular\" than Swift and has a more loyal following. One source said those prominent in GOP circles are considering a \"holy war\" on the singer if she aligns herself any further with Biden's campaign."

    "content": "Musician/producer/engineer Rob Bisel has eight Grammy nods this year for his work with SZA. SZA is the most nominated artist at this year’s Grammy Awards with nine total nods. As the co-writer, producer, mixer and engineer for the album  , Rob Bisel is right there with SZA. For his work with SZA, Bisel has eight nominations this year, including ones for the big three — Song, Record and Album of the Year. Bisel worked as an engineer for Rick Rubin at Rubin’s Shangri-La studio in Malibu. Rubin sent Bisel to Hawaii to work with SZA in January of 2020. During that time Bisel and SZA formed a bond that they continued while working together during the COVID lockdown. The result was SOS. Sage Bava and I met with Bisel and his dog Ponzu in his Los Angeles studio to discuss his creative process, his work with SZA, what he learned from Rubin and Kendrick Lamar and much more. Rob Bisel: It's definitely ramping up. There are a lot of events and stuff next week, various parties and mixer things. So, it's starting to get there. Yeah, the buzz is starting to pick up for sure. Bisel: Right, it's super exciting. And it's a good way to set up your next couple of projects. You never know who's going to be there. I have a friend, this producer, Earl on the Beat, and he produced the Doja Cat songs, “Paint the Town Red” and “Agoura Hills.” He said he met her at a Grammy party last year and just struck up a conversation. So, it's good to do the rounds, run into people. You never know what'll come out of it. So yeah. Bisel: Doja Cat would be cool. I don't know though. I'd love to meet a cool new artist that is doing something exciting. There's a good chance to find new talent too. So, I'm stoked to get out there and meet some people. Bisel: I'm trying to do more songwriter-oriented music this coming year. I guess that's not dissimilar from what I've done in the past, but it feels like there's a lot of good music being made by artists that are like writers' writers. Someone like Noah Kahan comes to mind, he's just an A-plus writer. And it's not uncommon anymore for writers of all different genres that can really carry their own weight when it comes to writing a song, which I don't think historically has always been the case. It wasn't uncommon for pop artists to be spoon-fed songs that they had no attachment to. Bisel: Million percent. I think we ran into a brick wall on one end of the spectrum of overly processed program music. Especially I think after COVID too, people want music that makes them feel like they're in a live performance, like in the room with someone else. Not just this alien sort of thing with no soul, no life to it. It's got to feel like it was made by a human. I think those human connections that can be communicated through music sometimes are more important than ever, just cause of where the world is at right now. Bisel: Elliott Smith, for sure. That immediately jumps off the page for me. Every decade, I feel like there would be someone different. But I don't know, when I think songwriters, he's someone that, for me, comes to the top of my mind. But, if I really thought about every decade I could spit out a couple different names for you. Bisel: I've been lucky to work with some amazing artists that can write. I really appreciate that. And I don't take that for granted. I don't think of myself as a crazy songwriter, but I think I'm good at giving perspective and feedback to good writers and helping challenge and poke holes in whatever they're doing, hopefully for the better. So yeah, that's how I see myself fitting into the whole little puzzle there. Bisel: There's a lot of intangible stuff for sure. I love working with people that are down to try everything. I like working with people that are down for \"dumb ideas\" and they'll even give those a shot. It's important for everyone in a creative environment for that to be the case, just cause you don't want to be over-thinking every idea because your dumb idea may end up being the breakthrough genius thing. And if you're in your own head thinking like, “Oh, so and so who's sitting five feet away from me is going to think this is stupid.” You're going to be second guessing and doubting yourself the whole time. This is not a fun headspace to be in when you're making music with people. So, first and foremost, that comes to mind for me. Yeah. Bisel: Something that comes to mind, in terms of production and stuff, is this SZA song, “Low.” The core of the beat is actually that accordion sitting right there, and it's this hard aggressive trap beat. You wouldn't really think of accordion, that wouldn't be your first choice of sounds for something like that. I don't think SZA ever balked at the idea of having an accordion song. The other people that I made that beat with, they didn't ever stop and think, “Why are we doing this?” They were just down to try stuff. That's one thing that comes to mind for sure. Bisel: One thing I work on is being really consistent about making things. I read a really cool interview with Jerry Seinfeld a year or two ago, where he talked about every day he sits down and just writes by himself for one hour. That's all he does. He isn't looking at his phone, jus him, a pad of paper and a cup of coffee. There are no distractions. I try to be habitual about sitting down and making stuff and knowing that even a little voice memo you make late at night as you're going to bed, that could be the core of a song someday. I think I'm pretty good at being able to polish up and get a song across the line. Bisel: Yeah, I learned a ton cause I spent several years working at a studio as a studio assistant and an engineer there. I was an assistant for probably six months on the most recent Kendrick [Lamar] album to come out. I learned so much watching his teamwork. They would make several different versions of every song and they'd record horns on something for a day and then they wouldn't even end up using it. Just seeing the dedication of that team and how willing they were to try a million things even if it almost definitely was never going to see the light of day. And not leaving any creative stone unturned. I'd say that was a really cool experience. I learned a lot from just watching them and I try to keep that in mind as I'm going through revisions of a song or trying alternate versions. Bisel: That's the magic of a song usually. I’m trying to always keep that in mind and protect that at all costs. It's easy to go down the rabbit hole and lose track of that initial spark for something. But I think it's always super important, especially as you're \"finishing\" up a song, to go back and listen to your first version of it or your first demo and just make sure that all these steps you did along the way actually were better. Cause it's easy to trick yourself into thinking, “Oh I put all this work and time into something, it must be better.” But oftentimes it's really not. It's really important to preserve that initial core idea. Bisel: it’s honestly her. It's funny cause I had a handful of people ask me what the gear was, what the plug-ins were, whatever. That stuff helps but it really is her. The best singers, that's always the case. In my days as a studio assistant, I was lucky enough to be in the room with some legendary singers. I was in a session with Neil Young thinking, “Oh, he just sounds like this. It's not like an effect or a mic. That's just Neil.” She has that indescribable quality right out of the gate. I try to do what I can so that when her voice is coming out of the speakers, it's more palatable to her and feels more in line with how she wants the world to hear her. I try not to get in the way and screw things up too much and get too heavy handed with it.   Bisel: Well said. So often people want to put their stamp on a thing. But I had a realization lately that the \"best producers\" almost always are the ones that are just working with the best artists. And if you want to get the best song, just put the spotlight on the artist, don't put the spotlight on yourself. You'll be a better producer for it, and the spotlight will in turn come back to you because you gave the people what they wanted. They don't want you, they want them. Hopefully that doesn't upset too many producers out there, but that's the truth. Bisel: Rick Rubin is an obvious answer there. I learned so much working at his spot in Malibu. I think he's the master of identifying what makes certain artists, unicorns and not getting in the way of whatever takes your breath away by hearing Johnny Cash singing in his later days. Not diluting that in any way, or what makes the Chili Peppers feel untamed."

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks during a news conference at the Fulton County  Willis, who has not publicly responded to the allegations, plans to argue that she has not breached any laws that would require her to step aside in the case,  , citing sources familiar with her thinking. Willis has faced intense backlash since one of Trump’s co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case, Mike Roman, alleged in a January court filing she hired a lead prosecutor in the case, Nathan Wade, after the two had a “clandestine” relationship, his attorneys wrote, accusing Willis of violating ethical standards and creating an “impermissible conflict of interest.” Roman’s attorneys did not provide direct evidence on Willis’s alleged relationship with Wade, instead citing unnamed sources, though credit card statements revealed in Wade’s divorce proceedings show he paid for flights for her to Miami and San Francisco—which Wade’s wife   can only be explained by a “romantic relationship.” Some legal experts have expressed doubts there is legal standing to force Willis or Wade off the case, but others have suggested one or both should voluntarily remove themselves as the allegations threaten to taint the case in the eyes of jurors and raise ethical questions. “I’d tell her to get out of the case. I really think in this type of case with these allegations, this case is bigger than any one prosecutor,” CNN legal analyst and former Georgia US Attorney Michael Moore   the network. “And I think probably to preserve the case to show what’s most important to her is the facts of the Trump case as opposed to her political career if you will at this moment.” If Willis were to recuse herself, it could potentially delay the case and push the trial beyond the November general election, as a   would need to reassign the case. Willis has proposed an Aug. 5 trial date in the case, which charges Trump and 18 co-defendants with racketeering and other felonies related to their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Willis has not publicly responded to the allegations, outside of a statement she made before a church congregation on Jan. 14 defending Wade’s qualifications and questioning whether her adversaries were “playing the race card.” Willis was subpoenaed to testify in the divorce case before it was settled on Tuesday. Contesting the subpoena request, she accused Wade’s wife, Jocelyn Wade, of “obstructing and interfering” with the prosecution against Trump in an effort to harm her reputation. Friday is Willis’ deadline to respond to the allegations. She could also be called to testify in a Feb. 15 hearing, where both sides will present evidence. The GOP-led Georgia state legislature also voted last week to form a special committee to investigate Willis."

    "title": "Why Conspiracy Theorists Think Taylor Swift Is A Pentagon ‘Psy-Op’",
    "content": "Screenshot from the Jan. 9, 2024 episode of the Fox News show featuring Jesse Watters alleging  Have you heard the claim that musician Taylor Swift is a secret “psy-op” used by the Pentagon to influence public opinion? It was a claim largely relegated to conspiracy theorists on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, before Jesse Watters did a segment about the idea on Fox News on Tuesday. But the Fox News segment takes a viral video wildly out of context. Watters played a clip from a NATO conference, but didn’t give any necessary context to his viewers about what they were watching. And Watters seems to think Swift’s popularity in itself is a sign of some dark forces pulling strings behind the scenes. “Have you ever wondered why or how she blew up like this?” Watters asked viewers after rattling off Swift’s accomplishments on Tuesday night in a segment first flagged by  . “Well, around four years ago, the Pentagon psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset during a NATO meeting. What kind of asset? A psy-op for combatting online misinformation,” Watters told viewers. Watters then played a heavily edited clip of a presentation given by an academic, suggesting there was some nefarious reason Swift and her music are so popular. “Yeah, that’s real. The Pentagon psy-op unit pitched NATO on turning Taylor Swift into an asset,” Watters continued. But what’s actually going on here? Something much more nuanced and less sensationalistic than what Watters is telling his audience. The woman in the clip, Alicia Marie Bargar, was giving a presentation about research she’d conducted with her team at Johns Hopkins University about how information spreads online. Bargar was presenting at the 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict, organized by NATO in 2019, though she’s a civilian and has no known contracts or relationship with the U.S. military. Bargar is an academic who was simply presenting her research at a conference on how information travels through social media. The entire presentation from 2019 is  , and it’s clear from the introduction that Bargar’s presentation is about hypothetical scenarios for how information can be manipulated. Bargar uses Taylor Swift as an example clearly because she’s the biggest pop star in the world right now. “The first one, and the most common [example of influence], is working with famous people or influencers to share information of a particular message. I include Taylor Swift in here because she’s a fairly influential online person, I don’t know if you’ve heard of her,” Bargar said jokingly. Bargar goes on to explain that Swift was standing next to a sign promoting voting in the most general way possible. The image from the presentation is a screenshot from an Instagram post showing Swift waiting in line   to vote. “Celebrities, at least in the U.S., regularly will post pictures of themselves with an encouragement for people to go vote, and this has a measurable effect on voter turnout,” Bargar said in her 2019 presentation. Instagram post by Taylor Swift from 2016 telling people to go out and vote. That’s it. Bargar wasn’t saying that anyone should use Swift as a way to influence public opinion on any given topic, just that she’s an example of a famous person with influence who once gave a generic “go vote” message to her fans on Instagram. And by watching the full presentation you can see how Watters stripped all the nuance and context out of what his viewers were watching, instead presenting a very distorted and intellectually dishonest argument. The way Watters tells it, this was a NATO “meeting” where people were just floating ideas about how to turn Taylor Swift into a tool for propaganda against the American public. In reality, it was a conference where an academic presented research about the flow of information and gave Swift as an example of someone with influence because she’s literally the biggest musician on the planet right now. There’s absolutely no evidence that the U.S. government or anyone else is using Swift as a tool of spreading misinformation, as Watters continually suggested on Tuesday. Watters didn’t stop there, though. The Fox News host brought on  , a former FBI agent, to elaborate on all the spooky hypotheticals about how Swift would indoctrinate the country’s youth to vote for Joe Biden. Again, this is all speculation with virtually nothing grounded in reality. The video of Bargar’s full presentation is quite interesting, showing how researchers are able to identify various threats, like social media accounts associated with the terror group ISIS. Bargar also notes during her presentation that her influence operations are often inspired by how public health messages operate, a subject that was obviously less controversial in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic would become a political football. However, Watters didn’t draw attention to the nuances of that research. Rather, he built the segment around the idea that major music figures would be trying to brainwash kids. Swift has long been thought by relatively fringe elements to be a psy-op. After   magazine named her person of the year near the end of 2023, chatter about how she would be “weaponized” in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election got louder, with allegations that Swift fans are zombies who can’t think for themselves. “Taylor Swift has a cult-like following that would drink poisoned Kool Aid for her. The media knows this and is feeding it,” the X account known as End Wokeness tweeted roughly  . “Music. Entertainment. Sports. Now they crowned her Person of the Year. The next step? Politics. If you don’t think the regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024, you clearly have not been paying attention,” the account continued. End Wokeness may be seen as a fringe voice online, but none other than Elon Musk, the owner of X, has frequently engaged with the account’s content. And that’s how many of the stranger conspiracy theories online now find their way into the public discourse, eventually landing on mainstream channels like Fox News. Call me crazy, but if I was going to run a psychological influence operation with a major celebrity, I probably wouldn’t produce a video about that exact possibility. I’ve reached out to the Fox News media office for comment about Tuesday night’s segment and will update this post if I hear back."

The settlement agreement comes amid an ongoing   between Willis and Wade that has embroiled the Fulton County district attorney and threatened to derail Trump’s high-profile election interference case, which Wade was hired to oversee.

Representatives for Willis and Wade didn’t immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment, though a Willis spokesperson told the   Monday that the DA’s office will respond to Roman’s claims “through appropriate court filings.” Willis is one of the lead prosecutors who charged Roman, Trump and 17 co-defendants in the election interference case last year. Roman, who pleaded not guilty, was charged with multiple felony counts accusing him of constructing a fake slate of Republican electors from multiple states to try to block the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. Trump was hit with 13 charges including conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree and a violation of Georgia’s racketeering and corruption act. However, the former president seeks to have the charges thrown out, arguing presidential immunity covered his actions during the 2020 presidential election.  (Forbes)  (WSJ)"

In this new spin on a Bob Marley hit, Caesar makes “Waiting In Vain” his own, delivering a fresh, passionate iteration of the song in his signature soulful style. When speaking with the   last year about his process, he confessed that his approach to music-making varies depending on the day. “I’ll go into a song thinking something and then, a lot of times, what I’m thinking is reflected in the song. Other times, I do the song just vibing and then I’m like, ‘Oh s**t, I didn’t even know that I thought that.’ I found it after,” he said. As for the idea of looking to the past, he mused to  , “Nostalgia is one of the great human weaknesses but it’s something I deeply enjoy.” In addition to Musgraves’ and Caesar’s contributions, the forthcoming EP will feature other new versions of beloved Marley songs like “One Love” by Wizkid, “Is This Love” by  , and “Exodus” by his own grandson Skip Marley. is in theaters Feb. 14."

    "title": "Amazon’s Flawed Password System Leads To More Stolen Packages",
    "content": "Amazon couriers are exploiting flaws in the one-time password system  An Amazon security system designed to ensure expensive items are delivered to the correct person is still backfiring on customers, 18 months after flaws in the system were first exposed. In July 2022, I   was being used to deny customers refunds for packages that were never delivered in the first place. The OTP system requires customers to give couriers a six-digit code before expensive items are handed over by the courier to the customer. But I reported on multiple cases in which customers who gave the correct code to the courier weren't given the expensive item, often when the person was receiving multiple packages at the same time and didn’t notice the expensive item was missing until the courier had left. Amazon customer support initially refused to refund affected customers, claiming that supplying the code was proof the expensive item was delivered. Since that July 2022 report, I’ve received a steady stream of complaints from customers who’ve experienced a range of problems with the OTP system. Tim Furdi from London has twice suffered as a consequence of Amazon’s OTP system. On the first occasion, a courier arrived at his London apartment to deliver a robot vacuum cleaner. The driver called Furdi when he arrived to deliver the package and said he needed the OTP to release the package to the concierge in his apartment block. But when Furdi went to collect the package from his concierge, no parcel had been left. “The driver was still there and he was adamant that he gave the parcel to reception, but reception denied that he had,” Furdi told me. “Then the driver became verbally abusive and left. I had to call Amazon many times about this and it took three weeks of internal investigations and checking footage before they refunded me.” Furdi had further OTP problems when he recently ordered a router. This time a driver arrived with a package and asked for the OTP, but after handing Furdi the parcel he “immediately realized it wasn’t mine, it was someone else’s,” Furdi said. The driver returned to his van to supposedly retrieve the correct package, but instead drove off. When Furdi contacted Amazon’s customer support he was told that “since I gave him the OTP there's not much they can do, they won't refund or redeliver.” The company has since fully refunded Furdi. It seems rogue couriers have found other ways to beat Amazon’s OTP system, too. Another reader contacted me to complain that their Google Pixel phone had supposedly been delivered while they were out, without ever giving the OTP to the driver. The reader claimed that in cases when the customer is unable to provide an OTP, courier drivers can instead use digits from the customer’s cell phone number as proof of identity. Amazon doesn’t provide drivers with the customers’ phone numbers, but drivers can call customers using an Amazon system where the number is hidden. In this instance, the call went through to the customer’s voicemail, which has a generic message stating “you have reached the answerphone service for” and then proceeds to read out the customer’s number. The driver allegedly used these details to bypass the OTP security system and steal the package. Amazon customer services refused to offer a refund, claiming the delivery was confirmed by OTP. , where the courier rings them and tricks them into giving them their phone number, again using this to bypass the OTP and keep the package, which they know will contain an expensive item. “We work hard to understand the circumstances around every case and find a resolution with the customer. Customer satisfaction is our utmost priority, and we’re sorry that customer experiences in these cases did not meet the high standards we expect,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “We have implemented additional controls that are already making it even harder for bad actors to defraud customers, selling partners and Amazon. We are collaborating with the authorities, and are working tirelessly to improve the customer experience in these cases.”"

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Will Have Key Design Omissions, Insider Claims",
    "content": "When the iPhone 16 series arrives this fall, almost certainly, it may have two glaring omissions which could lead to less stellar sales, a new report claims. Not only will there be no “significant design changes” but one key driver of sales, generative AI, is not going to arrive at scale on the iPhone “until 2025 at the earliest.” Apple iPhone 15 Pro. How different will the iPhone 16 series be? Does this seem right? Well, it could be, because the report comes from one of the most reliable analysts out there, Ming-Chi Kuo from TFI Securities. Kuo’s   claims that Apple has “lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments of key upstream semiconductor components” by 15% compared to the year before, adding that this could mean “the most significant decline among the major global mobile phone brands in 2024.” Kuo claims that this is down to, “a new paradigm in high-end mobile phone design.” Kuo goes on to explain that this is because when people are choosing pricey cellphones, they are now looking at two different elements, AI and foldables. But hold on, you say, we weren’t expecting a foldable iPhone, but isn’t AI coming to the iPhone this year? There certainly have been strong rumors that Apple will announce big changes to iOS at WWDC in June, and it may even be the biggest update ever. But Kuo says that Apple “will not launch… the more comprehensive/differentiated GenAI ecosystem/applications until 2025 at the earliest.” Let’s put this a bit more positively. If it’s right that big AI changes are coming to iOS 18, as predicted, then hold on to your hats for what’s coming next year. Kuo also claims that there will be a “continued decline in shipments in the Chinese market,” because of the preference for a foldable phone at the premium end of the market, alongside “the return of Huawei”, the brand which had been flailing since restrictions on international product sales were placed on it, but has seen a resurgence in the last few months. How much will the next iPhone design differ from this one? The report also says “Apple will not launch new iPhone models with significant design changes,” again, not until 2025 or later. Of course, there have already been reports of new updates to the iPhone 16 range. These include  , wider implementation of the exceptional  , a new strategy for its  , more advanced  , noticeably  , a new thermal design to  , improved  , a new microphone   an  , designed for shooting video and an improved  . I mean, that’s quite a list, and you may feel that if all the above are delivered, that they add up to significant design changes already. And it’s only February! Plenty more leaks could appear before the fall. Again, if Kuo reckons that 2025’s improvements will be on a much bigger scale than this year’s, then I can’t wait."

    "title": "Samsung Makes New Free Offers For Galaxy S24 Users",
    "content": "Following an impressive reveal and popular pre-order window, Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones go on sale to the public today. And for those choosing Samsung's vision of smartphones, there are some tempting offers of free and discounted hardware alongside the new phones. Galaxy S24 Ultra on show at Galaxy Unpacked, January 17 2024, London, United Kingdom. The offers are not as wide-ranging as those in the pre-order window, which shouldn't be too surprising. The chance to bump up the onboard storage to the next tier was always going to be the most attractive offer, and hard to beat now the South Korean company is in full retail mode. Pre-orders tend to favor those buying their handsets SIM-free. I'd expect the majority of S24 sales to go through mobile carriers, which have a wide window of discounts they can offer thanks to the two-year-long contracts signed by consumers, allowing the financial impact of any offer to be spread over the 24 months of the contract. Here in the U.K., Samsung has an offer on top of any network or carrier offer. It has a free bundle of Galaxy Buds2Pro and SmartTag 2 for anyone who purchases a Galaxy S24, S24+ or S24 Ultra from a wide range of networks and retailers during February. These need to be claimed from Samsung within 30 days of purchase. Ordering directly from Samsung U.K. opens up another tier of offers. Those purchasing either the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24+ will receive a 5% discount on their first purchase over £500 in the Samsung Shop App; and a 30% discount on both the Galaxy Watch6 Classic and two years of Samsung Care+. Finally, there’s a 12-month subscription to the Disney+ streaming service. You also have exclusive online colors; Sapphire Blue, Jade Green and Sandstone Orange for The S24 and S24+, and Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, or Titanium Orange for the Galaxy S24 Ultra. I think Samsung would like you to know that the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses titanium as a material. As we saw with the pre-orders, the offers have regional variations. Those buying the S24 Ultra handsets in the U.S. can pick up discounts on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Galaxy Watch6 and Galaxy Watch6 Classic. At the same time, Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ owners have discount offers for the Galaxy Buds FE, Watch6 and Waatch6 Classic. Check your local listings for details, and remember that network pricing and offers may vary. Tthe flagship Galaxy S24 at Samsung's flagship store in Shanghai, China (CFOTO/Future Publishing via  Outside of the offers, the U.S. prices for SIM-free handsets—broadly indicative of other regions, are as follows; Samsung’s aggressive offers worldwide should boost sales of the Galaxy S24 family while the company has a short window of advantage. By bringing the launch date forward from the traditional mid-February slot ahead of Mobile World Congress, Samsung has not only a clear run with press coverage, but pre-orders and sales lock people into the handset and ecosystem for the next year or two before MWC highlights countless other premium smartphones. The Galaxy S24 launch is also comfortably clear of the Apple iPhone. The community that always buys iPhones will have made their purchases now, leaving a pool of less committed users to Apple’s vision. Samsung is facing an audience who want a reason to buy. The latest offers are making the Galaxy offer as tempting as possible."

    "title": "Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds Long-Term Review: Refined Excellence",
    "content": "Sony WF-1000XM5 case The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds have been my travel companion for the past two months now. There’s plenty to like – the sound, the battery life, improved active noise cancelation (ANC) and a more compact design. While comfort and fit remain subjective, Sony has introduced some significant changes, but not all of them translate to a better experience. I had one prominent issue with the Sony XM4 earbuds – the size. That’s because it felt too big to fit in my pockets alongside the phone. Sony has worked on it and reduced WF-1000XM5 dimensions, so it’s noticeably smaller and much more portable, which I love. The difference is more noticeable when you open the case because the earbuds have been shrunk too. As per the company, the earbuds are 25% smaller than the predecessor, and 20% lighter. If you have used the XM4s, you’d be delighted to put in the XM5s in your ears because they no longer feel bulky. It’s a significant improvement in design but not in material used. The matte and glossy finish looks classy but the glossy finish on the earbuds’ sides causes issues. In my time with the XM5s, there have been zero (okay, almost zero) instances where I was able to take out the earbuds from the case in one try until I figured out the correct way of plucking them out. Push-and-pull the earbuds instead of pulling with two fingers You need to push and pull with a thumb and finger instead of pull with two fingers to get them out of the case. The glossy material provides no grip, so if you have sweaty or greasy fingers, you are going to struggle with them unless you use the thumb method. Ideally, taking out the earbuds and putting them in your ears should be a natural, seamless experience, but it isn’t on the Sony WF-1000XM5. The earbuds come with proprietary foam tips. You get four of them in the box, including extra small, small, medium and large. If you put them in and realize that the ANC isn’t effective, that’s because these tips don’t work like silicone tips. You need to insert and twist, so they expand to seal the ears and perform as intended with ANC on. You can always swap them for silicone eartips if the new foam material doesn’t feel comfortable to you. Like before, the XM5 earbuds are rated IPX4 for sweat resistance. The Sony WF-1000XM5 comes equipped with all-new 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X, which is larger than the 6.4mm found on the XM4s. According to Sony, this helps reduce mechanical noise, which is hard to notice. The earbuds support SBC, AAC and LDAC codecs. For Android phones, LDAC offers better sound but isn’t enabled by default on all the devices, so be mindful of turning it on. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbud The Sony XM5 earbuds bring in more clarity and dynamics. I enjoyed listening to songs that have acoustic guitar or piano playback with vocals being clear. The earbuds sound more open than before. While the XM4 had more thumping bass response, these sound more controlled, detailed and overall better in lower frequencies. The treble is more refined too. All of this is with ANC on, but turn the noise cancelation off, and you’ll get a more natural sound. The WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature six microphones, a bone conduction sensor and a noise reduction engine with AI machine learning to offer a better calling experience than before. I was thoroughly impressed with the call quality and wind reduction tech. These are some of the best earbuds for calls. You can also use head gestures (can be toggled in the Headphones app) to accept or reject calls. But they don’t work 100% of the time. You can choose from Google Assistant, Siri or Alexa for voice assistance. I set up Alexa and making hands-free calls by saying the trigger word and command worked eight out of 10 times. The new Sony earbuds feature a new integrated processor V2 and HD Noise Canceling processor QN2e that work together to bring top-notch ANC performance. I’ve been on a few flights, and these have been my go-to earbuds for travel because these the ANC doesn’t give a vacuum-like effect that could make your ears uncomfortable. It’s right up there or even a notch better than AirPods Pro 2’s ANC but I prefer Apple’s transparency mode. Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds case back In terms of features, you get dynamic head tracking, which is cool to have but I prefer having it off. The app offers a quick optimization process to fine-tune the head tracking, which works with Netfix and YouTube to offer a more immersive experience. The Sony XM5 earbuds support multipoint connectivity so you can connect to two devices simultaneously. It works flawlessly. Other Sony-exclusive features like Speak-to-Chat and Adaptive Sound Control are present too. The latter controls the amount of ambient sound to push in your ears depending on where you are and what you’re doing. For instance, you can have ANC off when you’re moving. Notably, it requires your location data to work. One of the worst parts of non-stem earbuds design is that you are limited by controls because there’s only so many things you can do with a few taps. But on the XM5s, you can customize them for play/pause, ANC modes and volume – all at the same time, like the  . For reference, the XM4s didn’t let you operate all three together, and you could only choose two out of these three functionalities. The Sony WF-1000XM5 can last up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, while the charging case adds another 24 hours of playback time. You get wireless charging support and fast charging that can give you an hour worth of battery life with a three-minute charge. I didn’t find myself out of charge when needed. The battery life is better than the AirPods Pro 2 (six hours). Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds in black The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds feature a new design that’s smaller, lighter and more comfortable than before. There’s a minor inconvenience that you can make peace with because you get rich, clear and immersive sound and call quality. The ANC performance is top-class too. The Sony WF-1000XM5 remain the earbuds to beat in terms of sound, features and ANC. At $280 / 24,990 INR, these are an easy recommendation for Android users. These perform well with the iPhone too but AirPods Pro 2 offer a more seamless experience."

The latest   highlight TSMC’s plans for 2nm chipsets, with Apple in pole position to launch a new iPhone with this next generation of silicon. Chips built on the 2nm will offer better permanence with more efficient use of power, just as 3nm picked up similar benefits over the 5nm process. Over the next few years, smartphone manufacturers will be delivering more AI features to consumers. The biggest signal is Samsung, with Galaxy AI dominating the recent Galaxy Unpacked launch event for the S24 family of smartphones. AI has been highlighted not just by other Android-based manufacturers but by chip manufacturers such as   and  . We’ve yet to see how Apple will specifically address AI in the iPhone—the upcoming launch of iOS 18 at June’s Worldwide Developer Conference will be a key moment in Apple’s AI story. With Qualcomm and its competitors all building support for AI into the hardware, unless Apple completely opts out of using AI in its mobile platforms, it will have to follow with the upcoming A18 and A19 Apple Silicom chipsets. With the A19 chipset set for a 2025 debut, that sits nicely in the pocket for a switch to the 2nm process. And that means there will be a significant increase in the capability of the A19, and therefore the iPhone 17 Pro, over the 3nm-based A18 and the iPhone 16 Pro. Similar to the older iPhone “S” handsets that kept pace with the industry specifications but did not push the envelope in any way, the iPhone 16 Pro looks like a transitionary handset that will do little more than iterate on the existing hardware. Any major changes will need to be in software, meaning AI will have to make up the difference."

    "title": "How Stock Outs Or Shortages Affect Private Healthcare And Consumers",
    "content": "Pharmacist checking the shelves with a digital tablet Essential medicines are drugs that the World Health Organization has deemed crucial for a population to have reliable and regular access to. Many of these are life saving drugs. However, in the low and middle-income countries, “stock outs” of these medicines are very common. The stockout rates at public health facilities are estimated to be as high as 33%. There are even higher rates observed for specific classes of medicines, such as drugs for HIV-positive patients as well as for treating malaria. It is important to note that the precise number of stockout rates depend on specific countries and time periods. For patients, the absence of drugs can mean prolonged illness, disrupted treatments for chronic conditions, increased rates of morbidity, and even deaths; all that could have been avoided. When public supplies dwindle, patients are often forced into the private sector, where the costs are markedly higher. In Uganda, for instance, during stockouts the price of antimalarial drugs can surge by 35%. As demand spikes in private facilities due to public shortages, those who can least afford it face steep prices. Consequently, some patients opt to forgo treatment entirely. Furthermore, there is also the cost of time and hassle as patients go across multiple health facilities in hopes of getting treated. Overall, drug shortages work to decrease trust in the healthcare system. Stockouts are also frustrating and demotivating for public sector health care providers in low-income settings, who are unable to appropriately treat patients. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, experience a different set of challenges and opportunities. An influx of patients might can strain resources and inflate prices due to increased demand. This not only affects the reputation of these providers but also raises ethical concerns about profiting from public sector shortcomings. Public health facility stockouts send ripples through the healthcare landscape, compromising patient health, adding financial strain, and pressuring private providers. Overall, drug shortages work to decrease trust in the healthcare system. There are numerous initiatives to reduce stockouts by improving supply chain operations and access to high-quality medicines worldwide, such as the Global Fund and PEPFAR. But more work and research is needed to ensure reliable access to medicines worldwide. It's a stark reminder that when one part of the healthcare system falters, the entire network feels the tremors. Ensuring the availability of essential medicines in public facilities is not just about health equity; it's about stabilizing the entire healthcare ecosystem for the well-being of all. — Did you know that drug shortages also happen in the US? Year 2023 saw the highest number of active drug shortages on average (measured quarterly) since 2015."

    "content": "Apple’s MacBook line-up is a sprawling mix of Air and Pros, M3s and M2 Maxs, various screen sizes and multiple designs. It’s far from the clean and simple lines the Apple brand promises. Yet there was another way of laying out the various MacBook laptops that would have delivered just that. Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (Photographer: Philip Pacheco/Bloomberg) Speaking with   (via  ), long-time tech reporter Walt Mossberg talked about then Apple Design Chief Jony Ive wanting to unify the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines into a single behemoth “MacBook” offering, reasoning that the MacBook Pro could be engineered to be just as thin and portable as the MacBook Air. As we know, that didn’t happen, but the next MacBook Air at this time saw minimal changes, but enough to mark it out as a new product. Apple’s Intel-powered MacBook line-up remained crowded and confused. It’s a problem that Apple magnified when the launch of Apple Silicon paired the consumer-focused M1 chipset into both a MacBook Air case and a MacBook Pro case. The former was clearly a great pairing, but the latter was little more than the MacBook Air with a fan to help cooling; the true MacBook Pro models would arrive six months later with a new design, a choice of 14-inch and 16-inch displays, and the professionally focused M1 Pro and M1 Max Apple Silicon chipset. The M1 MacBook Pro was stranded.. too expensive compared to the MacBook Air and too underpowered compared to the other MacBook Pro laptops. There was a thin argument that you wanted both the Air and Pro brands on show in the move to Apple Silicon, but Apple continued with its Frankenstein MacBook Pro in both the M2 and M3 generations. This brings me back to Ive’s focus on a smaller portfolio offering value at each segment, following the Apple tradition of a good/better/best offering for the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac, and the MacBook. If Ive were to have his way and merge the Air and the Pro into a singular MacBook category, how would the Apple Silicon family have looked? You’d have the entry-level model that delivers for the consumers—which would more than likely be the MacBook with M3, the mid-tier MacBook with M3 Pro, and a top-tier MacBook with M3 Max. Throw in the choice of a 14-inch or 16-inch display, and you have a simplified range which everyone understands and is confident they have the best model for their needs. Instead, Apple has a confusing mess of Airs and Pros, with different markets targeted by similar machines, mismatched steps in both performance and design and a portfolio that feels designed to upsell you to the next model."

Fulton County Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade settled a divorce case with his wife, meaning District  Cobb County Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson approved a temporary settlement on Tuesday, noting that Wade and his wife, Joycelyn Wade, will agree to the exact terms of the settlement outside of the court.

    "title": "Springsteen, McCartney In The House To Fete Jon Bon Jovi At MusiCares’ Pre-Grammys Gala",
    "content": "Jon Bon Jovi performs at the MusiCares 2024 Person of the Year Gala. The stars came out to fete Jon Bon Jovi, MusiCares’ 2024 Person of the Year, in a February 2 gala and concert at the Los Angeles Convention Center held two days before the 66th Grammy Awards. Sammy Hagar, Melissa Etheridge, Jason Isbell, Shania Twain, Brandy Clark, Damiano David of Måneskin, Goo Goo Dolls, Jelly Roll, Train’s Pat Monahan, Marcus King, Mammoth WVH, The War And Treaty and Lainey Wilson were among those who celebrated the rock icon with rousing renditions of some of his most beloved songs. Even a deep personal loss didn’t keep fellow Jersey boy Bruce Springsteen from showing up to support his friend. Springsteen’s mom Adele passed, at age 98, on Tuesday night. “Bruce’s mom passed two days ago, and when I first got the news he was already on the airplane here,” Bon Jovi said from the stage. “I certainly would’ve understood if he’d said he could’t make it. But he wanted to be here tonight for MusiCares and he wanted to be here tonight for me, and I am forever grateful to you for everything.” Paul McCartney didn’t take the stage, but he and his wife Nancy Shevell were seated with Bon Jovi and his wife Dorothea alongside Rita Wilson and Springsteen. Grammy-nominated comedian Jim Gaffigan hosted the 33rd annual MusiCares benefit and kept the crowd laughing with assessments of Bon Jovi’s hair and wardrobe choices through the years, and a continual flow of hilarious bits. Noting the universal appeal of the honoree’s songs he asked, “Have you been to a wedding reception and not drunkenly sung along to ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’”? Lenny Kravitz, Gayle King and Kylie Minogue were presenters, and John Mayer, Matthew McConaughey, Ed Sheeran, Pink and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker offered up well wishes via video. In a night of soaring, adeptly curated performances, Springsteen kicked off the tributes on the highest of notes. After Bon Jovi and his band opened the show with a preview of the single “Legendary” off their forthcoming album, Bon Jovi called up “my mentor, my brother, my hero”—and the Boss took the stage. They immediately fell into the inspired harmonizing, riffing and strumming through Bon Jovi’s “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” that can only materialize from two musicians who’ve clocked many a late-night hour jamming. Which in itself would’ve been more than enough had they not immediately segued into Springsteen’s own song “The Promised Land,” with Bon Jovi on Springsteen’s signature harmonica lines. The bar was set. The party was on. At the start, Bon Jovi told the crowd of 2,000 guests—dressed to the nines and in the house to bolster the arm of the Recording Academy that supports the health and welfare of the music community: “I want to remind you, this here’s a Bon Jovi concert. We don’t sit down.” And in large part they had no problem abiding during the two-plus-hour trip through through the songbook of the Grammy-winning and 11-time nominee, who with his band and as a solo artist has sold more than 130 million records worldwide. Etheridge, accompanied by Best Contemporary Blues Album nominee Larkin Poe, struck just the right chords on “Blaze of Glory.” Jelly Roll, nominated this year for Best New Artist, put his soulful twang on “Bad Medicine. The night’s power ballad moments belonged to War And Treaty’s gorgeous rendition of “I’ll Be There for You” and Clark’s “(You Want To) Make A Memory.” David once again showcased his rockstar chops on “Keep the Faith” and Mammoth WVH, fronted by Wolfgang Van Halen, son of the late Eddie Van Halen, cranked the volume loudest with their excellent rendition of “Have A Nice Day.” Robert Kraft, businessman and owner of the New England Patriots, presented Bon Jovi with his Person of the Year trophy, acclaiming his status not only as rock star but as a humanitarian and philanthropist who’s kept “his empathy for the world at large” even as he ascended to the musical stratosphere. Among Bon Jovi’s many contributions, in 2006 he established the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, an organization dedicated to disrupting the cycle of hunger, poverty and homelessness. After giving special shoutouts to Springsteen and McCartney, Bon Jovi graciously thanked his entire circle — the “we in the me,” as called them. “Everything that I’ve accomplished with or without the band or in my philanthropic life has had the support of my family, my friends, bandmates, collaborators and an army of the willing, who’ve been ready to take my dreams and make them a reality.” Then, backed by his band and alongside the other performers, he closed out the night the only fitting way—with a triumphant version of iconic hit \"Livin' on a Prayer.” Complete list of 2024 MusiCares’ Person of the year performances in order of appearance:"

    "title": "Your iPhone Will Never Be The Same Again With Massive New iOS 17.4 Upgrade",
    "content": "The next big iOS update, iOS 17.4, is due in early March. It has  , including an update to the cool new   which has just launched. But Apple has more than striking new features in the update, and it could change the iPhone forever. Apple iOS 17.4 will radically change your iPhone. Just as important are the changes which are coming for iPhone users in the EU, which will significantly open up the device to third-party influences. Is that a good or a bad thing, and will users outside the EU see these changes? Read about the originally announced changes  , and read on for the latest analysis. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, in his most recent  , describes the changes as a sweeping overhaul of the software that powers the iPhone. While it’s currently affecting iOS, the App Store and the Safari browser in the EU, it “is more than just a local change. It’s a peek at the future of the platform and one that the company will likely have to adopt globally.” In other words, the changes which allow for rival app marketplaces to exist, which change Apple’s commission fees to app developers, will probably spread beyond the EU to affect everyone. The same will apply to the alterations to which web browser is the default choice on the iPhone. While many will welcome greater variety in app providers, and which web browser they can easily use, Apple says the new system could be less secure. Gurman points out that all this will affect Apple’s bottom line, as well as the iPhone’s security and privacy—and these are elements Apple takes seriously. He says, “As it frees up the iPhone’s software, the company is rolling out a slew of new anti-malware tools and warnings for both consumers and developers. It’s even requiring apps downloaded outside its App Store to go through a light review process and notarization.” Apple has new terms for developers who are thinking of moving from the App Store to rival marketplaces. The company has spelt out a deal which will save developers significant sums if they stay with Apple’s current ecosystem by cutting commission levels. For those developers who choose a different way, however, the result is reduced revenue for Apple, which it aims to make up for with new fees, such as the Core Technology Fee. This requires payments for each app install. Though the individual fee is low, $0.54, or 0.5€, and though this cost only kicks in above the first million installations, it all adds up. Gurman says, “Apple says that 99% of developers will see the amount they pay stay the same or decline. That all sounds great until you dive into the core technology fee, which feels like it was designed to strike right at Spotify, Meta and other large developers that offer their apps for free.” What’s clear is that from early March, the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, will change radically, in the EU at least. Apple’s changes have come as a response to the Digital Marketplace Act, and may change further, but the future is clearly going to be very different from where we are now. As Gurman says, “It all adds up to an iPhone that’s more customizable and less hostile to outside software.” Satisfying EU regulators may lead to a new era for the iPhone, and it could change how we use the phone as a result, potentially everywhere. Will there be changes to the software beyond what has already been announced? Stay tuned."

    "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max: New Report Claims Bold Upgrade Coming",
    "content": "Cameras are a key component on every smartphone, and it looks like the next iPhones will see a photographic improvement, at least in the larger version of the Pro iPhone released this fall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Here’s what’s coming. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: will the iPhone 16 Pro have a bigger camera sensor? According to Weibo user Digital Chat Station, in a report picked up by  , this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count. The new report claims that this year’s Max will be an “image flagship”. I mean, it is already. This report contrasts with other rumors that the Pro and Pro Max would have photographic capabilities that were closer to each other than this year, where the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a 5x zoom in its telephoto, but the iPhone 15 Pro only has room for a 3x zoom. That rumor still stands, that both Pro and Pro Max will have 5x zoom on the telephoto lens. But the Max, it seems, will still outstrip the regular Pro photographically, this time on the main camera sensor. The pixel count, the report claims, will stay at 48 megapixels for both phones. But the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a stacked design, which promises better performance. There’ll be a better Analog to Digital Converter and better noise control. Most important of all, the sensor size will increase from the 1/1.28 inch sensor found on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro, to a 1/1.14 inch sensor. That 12% size increase could promise significantly improved low-light performance, as well as greater dynamic range and improved background blur for better bokeh effects. This could all be done without increasing the thickness of the phone. More details will leak, but this is a promising upgrade for all iPhone users who enjoy taking the best photographs with the least effort."

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the many discussions around Apple in the last seven days. You can also  . The camera continues to be a battleground for smartphone manufacturers. 2024 has a difference, though, with the widespread use of AI being promoted by several manufacturers. Apple’s plans on the AI front are tied up in iOS 18 (which will likely be revealed in June at WWDC 2024). Until then, we have details on the hardware Apple will use to upgrade the Pro handsets: \"...this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera.

A new Apple iPhone 15 Pro with box and packaging (Photo illustration by John Keeble/Getty Images). Although the iPhone 15 Pro represents the best iPhone that Apple is offering, customer satisfaction has fallen well below the iPhone 15, reports the team at Perfect Rec. Part of that may well be down to the high expectations the Apple community had for the 15 Pro, expectations that Apple did not meet: \"We suspect the early adopter phenomenon might also be responsible for the large changes in satisfaction rates on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models between September and October. They may have had higher expectations for the phones and been somewhat disappointed by incremental upgrades than people who bought later in the cycle and may have been upgrading from older models.\" ( ). The iPhone modem continues to be an area where Apple can't design and build its way out of a reliance on Qualcomm. The purchase of Intel's modem division in 2019 was part of a plan to take production in-house, a plan that has so far failed to produce a usable modem. That has left Apple little choice but to continue its relationship with Qualcomm. This week, it confirmed that the deal will run for another two years, out to 2027. \"...Apple's work on a modem chip had been postponed until late 2025 or 2026, and it is possible it could see further delays. Apple was initially aiming to have an Apple-designed modem chip ready to go by 2024, but it missed that target. The company then wanted to introduce the modem chip in an   that would launch in spring 2025, but it will not be able to make that goal either.\" ( ). Apple is—incredibly reluctantly—opening up its iPhone App Store and payment services. While Apple is working hard to retain as much control over what can be installed on the phone someone has purchased, these changes are now available to the European public. Will that be the end of it? \"...the changes which allow for rival app marketplaces to exist, which change Apple’s commission fees to app developers, will probably spread beyond the EU to affect everyone.

You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device.\" ( ).

    "title": "iOS 17.4: How The iPhone Update That Changes Everything Affects Apps Like Spotify",
    "content": "Apple is about to release a huge update for the iPhone, iOS 17.4, coming in early March. There will be  , but part of it is Apple’s desire to comply with a new EU law, the Digital Markets Act, which comes into effect in March—hence Apple’s timing with its update. It will affect all 27 countries in the EU (the U.S. is only affected by some of these changes, though that could change in the future if the U.S. government follows the EU’s lead). Apple’s response to the EU law is to open up the iPhone software to let external app marketplaces in, while simultaneously trying to keep the iPhone safe from malware and other security issues. But some app developers are up in arms—like Spotify, which called the changes “extortion.” Where does the truth lie? The App Store on the iPhone is about to change.  Under the current arrangements, developers pay a commission to Apple when they charge for their apps or users buy digital goods or services through the app. The DMA was partly prompted by complaints from companies like Spotify, which filed   against Apple in 2019, calling the commission a tax. After Apple announced its new rules, Spotify described them as extortion. Apple responded in a statement: “We’re happy to support the success of all developers—including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice—with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.” Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify. A little background: Spotify stopped accepting premium subscriptions in the app in 2016 to avoid paying commission to Apple. And  , it switched any customers who had signed up for the premium tier to the free, ad-supported service, inviting them to sign up again using a different payment method outside the app. This means that right now, Spotify is not paying anything to Apple for placing the app in the iPhone App Store. Developers of free apps pay nothing to Apple to have their titles in the App Store. Since there are 1 billion iPhones out there, it’s a clever way to reach a huge audience. The market for streaming services is huge and growing fast, with Spotify the leading player. The changes required in the DMA are certainly complex—you can read details of them  . But where it most affects companies like Spotify is in something called the Core Technology Fee. The new rules mean that in the EU there will be options for alternative app marketplaces. These marketplaces can choose to use alternative payment methods. They won’t pay commission from the sales to Apple, but they will pay the CTF ($0.54, 0.5€). That fee is paid on the first annual install, after the app crosses the threshold of 1 million. If your app gets 999,999 installs, you pay nothing, if it’s 1,000,001 downloads in a year, the total owed to Apple is 0.5€. So, what’s the fuss about? Well, if you have 200 million downloads (Spotify’s subscriber number is higher than that), you are suddenly paying very significant sums. If Spotify decides to stick with the current terms, it will continue to pay nothing. But, understandably, it wants to offer its subscribers the most appealing way to switch to premium by signing up and paying in the app. To do that, it needs to pay the commission Apple requires under the current terms or else pay the CTF under the new terms, for example. Apple’s North Star, it says, is the privacy and security of users’ experience. The App Store is very safe, and keeping it that way is not cost-free to Apple. Apple’s view may be that developers like Spotify want access to the huge iPhone audience without recognizing or paying for the value that it brings."

    "title": "Nicki Minaj Has Never Won A Grammy—That Probably Won’t Change This Year",
    "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 08:  Recording artist Nicki Minaj attends The 57th Annual GRAMMY Awards  Throughout her lengthy and storied career, Nicki Minaj has accomplished some pretty incredible things. She’s made herself into the most successful female rapper of all time, and she’s proved her longevity and talent. While she has already managed so many impressive feats, there’s still one major honor that’s eluded her–a Grammy. Minaj is one of the most-nominated musicians without a Grammy win. She’s accrued a dozen nods, but somehow, she’s never walked away with a trophy. The superstar has more chances to change that fate this year, but it doesn’t look like her losing streak will be broken this time around. At the 2024 Grammy Awards, Minaj is up for two more prizes. She and Ice Spice are nominated for both Best Rap Song and Best Song Written for Visual Media for their single “Barbie World” from the   film and its accompanying soundtrack. “Barbie World” was another massive hit for Minaj, and it helped cement Spice as one of the hottest new stars in the music world. The tune rose to No. 7 on the Hot 100, bringing both artists back to the highest tier on that tally. Of the two awards she’s nominated for, Minaj likely has the best shot at winning Best Rap Song, which is gifted to the writers of a track, not necessarily the performing artists. In that field, she’s up against Doja Cat’s “Attention,” Lil Uzi Vert’s “Just Wanna Rock,” Killer Mike, André 3000, Future, and Eryn Allen Kane’s \"Scientists & Engineers,\" and Drake and 21 Savage’s “Rich Flex.” That last cut has been   by some in the industry as the likely winner, though it’s not all but certain. Minaj is also in the running for Best Song Written for Visual Media, but that category appears to be locked up for someone else. Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas will almost certainly take the Grammy for her hit single “What Was I Made For?” That tune, which is also from  , is also up for Record and Song of the Year, as well as the Academy Award for Best Original Song, so it seems like it’s the one to beat. These are just predictions, of course, and anything can happen when it comes to the Grammys. There have been plenty of surprises in the past, so Minaj shouldn’t be counted out. Many in the music industry feel that she’s been overlooked too frequently, and there’s a lot of excitement and love for newcomer Spice as well, so the chance to honor them both could be tempting to a lot of voters. While it doesn’t look like the odds are in her favor this time around, Minaj will almost surely earn more nominations at the 2025 Grammys. Her new album   was released within the current eligibility period, which will see trophies given out in a year. A number of singles from the rap star will also be in play, so she may score more nods–and maybe finally a win–soon."

    "content": "The Ukrainian 4th Tank Brigade in 2023. Five hundred tanks. More than 600 fighting vehicles. Hundreds of howitzers. Forty thousand troops. According to Ukraine’s eastern command, Russia has assembled a huge field army in eastern Ukraine opposite the free Ukrainian city of Kupyansk. It’s obvious what this army aims to do: retake a huge swathe of Kharkiv Oblast that the Russians briefly occupied in 2022—until a powerful Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated most of the oblast late that year. Everything east of the nearest major river is the goal. “The Russian Federation plans to seize the entire Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and part of Kharkiv Oblast up to the Oskil River by March 2024,” the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies  . The river threads through Kupyansk from the north. Why March? Because that’s when Russia will “vote” for “president” in a national “election.” In fact, Vladimir Putin is the only real candidate—and will maintain his brutal, dictatorial control over Russia  the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. A slice of Kharkiv would be an election-day gift to Putin from the Russian army in Ukraine. Some or part of around 10 Ukrainian brigades, anchored in the north by the 3rd Tank Brigade and south by the 4th Tank Brigade, defends Kupyansk and surrounding settlements. It’s a significant forces with perhaps 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks, fighting vehicles and howitzers. But people and vehicles aren’t the problem for the Ukrainians. The problem is  . The United States was one of the biggest donors of 155-millimeter shells for Ukraine’s best big guns—and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress cut off aid to Ukraine last fall. Since then, Ukrainian forces’ daily allotment of shells has fallen by two-thirds to just 2,000 rounds. Russian forces meanwhile fire as many as 10,000 shells a day, thanks to a steady supply of ammo from North Korea. Russia’s new firepower advantage allows it to concentrate artillery without much fear of Ukrainian counterbattery fire— . “This situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach: the systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible,” Ukrainian analysis team Frontelligence Insight  . The demolition already has begun. “Our satellite imagery reveals sustained and intense artillery damage” around Kupyansk, Frontelligence Insight reported. “Artillery shortages and delays in Western security assistance will create uncertainty in Ukrainian operational plans,” the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, D.C.  , “and likely prompt Ukrainian forces to husband materiel, which may force Ukrainian forces to make tough decisions about prioritizing certain sectors of the front over sectors where limited territorial setbacks are least damaging.” It’s not clear whether Kyiv is willing to trade away any of Kharkiv Oblast. With a pre-war population of 1.4 million, Kharkiv is Ukraine’s third city—and hosts strategic war industries including Ukraine’s main tank plant. So the Kupyansk garrison must hold. Anticipating the coming offensive, the Ukrainian defense ministry has organized new mechanized brigades and deployed them to Kupyansk to reinforce the garrison.  Perhaps most importantly, Ukrainian workshops are building explosives-laden first-person-view drones—tens of thousands of them per month. As artillery ammunition becomes scarce, Ukrainian brigades are flinging more and more FPVs at the Russians: sometimes thousands per day all along the 600-mile front. But the FPVs range just two miles or so—too short to target artillery that might be 15 or miles from the line of contact. Drone-operators have made quick work of small Russian assault groups that, for months now, have been probing the Kupyansk sector. But can a swarm of two-pound drones, even thousands of them, defeat 500 tanks and 650 fighting vehicles as they attack behind a wall of artillery fire? We may find out."

Joe Biden’s proposal to spend another $61 billion on the war effort, Ukraine’s artillery batteries were the first to feel this betrayal. That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

    "title": "Future Of Energy: How Solar Power Is Fueling The Cryptocurrency Boom",
    "content": "HILLSBOROUGH, NJ - JULY 15: Employees of SunEdison install photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of  How much energy does it take to mine Bitcoin ? This question often sends shivers down the spine of environmentalists who have always rallied against crypto mining. Regulators already frown upon the existence of cryptocurrencies, and major thinkers across the US are mulling over introducing a  . It might seem unfair, but these inflated emotions seem justified when you look at the stats: CoinGecko   that a solo miner would require 266,000 KwH to mine 1 Bitcoin. Now that the halving is upon us, this number will increase. Amidst environmental fears, skeptics often ignore one thing: According to CryptoSlate, more than   of Bitcoin mining relies on renewable sources of energy. Furthermore, more than 23% of it is done using hydropower, and over 7% of those renewable mining operations rely on solar power according to the same source. This percentage might not be that low for long. There have been concerted efforts to make solar energy more viable, with some conglomerates already setting up mining operations that harness the power of the sun. How much impact has solar power had on the cryptocurrency market? Let’s explore the nuances of solar-powered crypto mining and see how this future of energy might push the crypto adoption rate. Solar-powered crypto mining is now seen as more viable than ever, and there are many reasons for this. First, solar energy is clean and abundant. If harnessed properly, it can power whole mining operations without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. However, harnessing such energy comes at a cost. According to Finbold, considering a standard 400w solar panel, powering one mining rig will require  . But, this is easily curtailed since panels are now becoming more affordable thanks to the clean energy incentives introduced by the  . In fact, the cost of harnessing solar power has been falling for a long time. Shawn Rumery, senior director of research for the Solar Energy Industries Association,  , “Over the last decade, prices have come down by over 50% in the residential space.” Another big plus of using solar-powered mining is independence from the grid. It reduces the risk of power outages, causing less disruption to mining operations. This has resulted in Bitcoin mining becoming a new niche in the solar business. New players who want to engage with the crypto market in an affordable way are finding that investing in solar panels is a good way to go about it. For instance, in late 2022,   announced the launch of the world’s first solar-electric crypto mining rigs. Other companies, such as  ,  ,  , and more, are also trying to bring sustainable crypto-mining solutions, many of which use solar energy. Major investment companies are also rallying behind Bitcoin mining firms that leverage solar energy. For instance,  , a Bitcoin mining company that uses solar power for its mining operations, raised   in 2022. Now, the perks of solar mining won’t be limited to providing a clean ecosystem to mine; it can also encourage more investment into solar-powered systems. In the  ,   wrote, “Bitcoin mining could encourage investment in solar systems, enabling renewables to generate a higher percentage of grid power with no change in the cost of electricity.” They further noted that this can allow energy providers to “play the arbitrage between electricity prices and bitcoin prices.” This statement denotes a symbiosis between the two concepts — bitcoin mining and solar energy — paving the way for both sectors to prosper. These points are just the tip of the iceberg of reasons to be bullish about solar-powered Bitcoin mining. However, achieving a full transition to using solar energy is not easy. It is easy to ignore the realistic flaws of using solar-powered mining when benefits are all we want to see. Here, let’s discuss some of the key challenges people are going to contend with when implementing solar-powered mining. It all starts with the upfront cost of running a mining operation. While I already highlighted that solar panels are getting affordable, we have to ask ourselves if they are cheap enough. The truth is, we still have ways to go in terms of mass affordability. In an effort to highlight the cost-related challenges of solar-powered mining, I reached out to CEO of  , Rich Feola. “A full transition to solar energy for mining Bitcoin is going to be difficult,” he shared. “For now, individuals need to install multiple solar panels to run a single mining rig. As mining rigs become more energy efficient, we might see some growth, but it would be foolhardy to think that a complete transition to solar-powered Bitcoin mining will be coming so soon.” According to Architectural Digest, the national average cost of a solar panel is  . Considering the large number of solar panels to power a mining rig, an individual would be set back by more than $700k well before starting a mining operation. Solar energy is abundant, but it is also intermittent. For a solar panel to generate enough electricity, the sun should be bright and high. That means panels will not generate as much energy on cloudy days. Even though a high-voltage battery can be installed alongside the solar panel to store energy, don’t expect that power to last long during the rainy season: Solar batteries may not have enough capacity to constantly supply power to a mining rig. Another big challenge is having the space to install the panels. According to Freedom Solar Power, Bitcoin miners would need anywhere between   to power one formidable mining rig. A wider area is required if clouds are properly considered. If one buys the area to install solar panels, there will be additional upfront costs to deal with. And if that space is rented, the mining operation will have massive overhead to be paid monthly. The latter choice could put a severe dent on the profits made from Bitcoin mining, which is a big issue considering its volatility. Considering the upfront costs and space-related requirements of solar-powered mining, another big factor we must look at is whether mining Bitcoin is worth it. Bitcoin is an inherently volatile asset. Even though   is coming and more market leaders, such as Cathie Wood, are inclined to believe that it might reach  , chances of it happening are not set in stone. Furthermore, there are concerns about whether Bitcoin mining will be profitable after the halving. According to  , an American financial services firm,   may not be profitable once the upcoming halving arrives. Beyond halving, we must consider the other factors dictating the price of Bitcoin. Many countries don’t have any regulations in place to properly govern crypto yet, and those that do aren’t fond of the uncertainty this asset brings. Further, there is the community’s sentiment to consider, which changes on a whim. For instance, spot Bitcoin ETF approval was seen as a golden event that would bring institutional investors and pump the  . Instead, the value of the world’s leading crypto went from $46k to $42k when the approval happened. While these challenges make people think twice about the prospect of solar-powered Bitcoin mining, one cannot deny its eco-centric appeal. Furthermore, there are cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin that are aiming to make solar energy more accessible. Since it became clear that investors are veering towards solar energy and other renewable resources for their mining needs, multiple cryptocurrency projects have emerged to make renewable energy more viable.  is a leading project that rewards users for generating solar energy. For every one MwH energy generated, this project rewards miners with one SolarCoin. This incentive-based model acts as a motivator to make solar energy more mainstream. On the other hand, more large-scale projects like   seek to democratize renewable energy by allowing households, organizations, and even grids to trade energy. Such initiatives can create a symbiotic relationship between cryptocurrency and renewable energy resources. A growth in one could mean growth for the other. As crypto miners move towards renewable energy sources, solar energy is slowly catching their attention. Abundant and clean, solar power can make crypto mining more independent and affordable. However, it is equally important not to be blind to the challenges of solar-powered mining. Upfront costs are still high, the cryptocurrency market is still volatile, and there are only a few places where the sun shines bright and high enough to properly power a solar battery. Thankfully, certain cryptocurrency projects have entered the scene to make renewable energy more democratized. They are working in tandem to create a crypto boom in the market. But how loud will this explosion be? Only time will tell."

    "title": "How New Bitcoin ETFs Effect The Bitcoin Price",
    "content": "A smart phone is displaying the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF stock on the NASDAQ market in this photo  The digital assets space has been fixated since BlackRock  announced its intentions to create a spot bitcoin ETF on June 15, 2023. Other companies had filed previously, but BlackRock only had one rejection out of over  , so anticipation was high. The mere possibility of the world’s largest asset manager creating a bitcoin ETF led to a 96% price rally up to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval on January 10. Therefore, it is pretty clear that bitcoin ETFs can at least indirectly affect the price of bitcoin. Yet, now we have nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., will there be a more direct impact on the bitcoin price? When investors buy or sell bitcoin on a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, each trade directly affects bitcoin’s price, with the exchange’s order book matching buyers with sellers 24/7. The displayed bitcoin price is the average of what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers are prepared to receive for their bitcoin. Therefore, whether an investor buys $10 or $1,000 worth of bitcoin on an exchange directly impacts the price in real time. These prices are then curated across all exchanges and trading pairs to give a global bitcoin price. Global   allow investors to identify potential arbitrage opportunities when prices differ across exchanges. These traders help ensure prices ultimately diverge toward a single value. Global combined bitcoin order book However, when it comes to bitcoin ETFs, things get more complicated. While the new spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the bitcoin price directly, they do not impact it in the same way. Buying a share of an ETF has no real-time impact on bitcoin’s price through direct means. In fact, the bitcoin represented by the share is not even purchased until the next trading day. Shares of the ETFs can only be created by organizations authorized in the issuer’s prospectus. These Authorized Participants for BlackRock include JP Morgan and Jane Street. APs submit an order for new shares to the ETF along with cash. The bitcoin reference rate is then set between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. EST and used to calculate the number of shares to issue. Once this is complete, the shares are delivered to the AP, and it can either offer them to the market or hold them on its balance sheet. When ETF shares are subsequently bought or sold, the price fluctuates like any other fund, but there is no direct impact on bitcoin. Shares can trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value when the correlation becomes decoupled. However, similar to how arbitrage opportunities across bitcoin exchanges help keep the price within a set range, bitcoin futures are often used to help keep bitcoin ETF shares in line. Whenever there is a substantial discount or premium to NAV for a bitcoin ETF, traders purchase or sell bitcoin futures on platforms such as CME to counteract the spread and collect the futures premium. Finally, to fulfill the APs’ orders, bitcoin is bought and sold over the counter with the institutional trading platform Coinbase Prime. These trades are less transparent as they are not included in the global combined order book. While transfers in and out of Coinbase Prime can be traced on-chain, internal off-chain transactions are not made public. The trades are peer-to-peer, with entities exchanging large amounts of bitcoin at a mutually agreed price. Public awareness of large bitcoin sales, such as those made recently by Grayscale, can make investors wary. However, the opaque nature of these large OTC trades and their lack of integration into global order books reduce their overall market impact on the bitcoin price. While there is sufficient liquidity at present to manage ETF demand within OTC desks, this may change in the future. The absolute maximum supply of the Bitcoin network is set at 21 million coins, and thousands of bitcoins enter ETFs daily. Conversely, only 900 BTC is mined every day, which will fall to 450 BTC within the next 80 days, following the next halving. If demand continues, the fixed supply of bitcoin may make it harder to create new ETF shares. At this point, the ETFs could substantially affect the bitcoin price, as ETFs may have to source bitcoin directly from exchanges. Ultimately, the effect on the bitcoin price will play out over months and years, not hours and days. The short-term anticipation and excitement for a spot bitcoin ETFs was perhaps overstated. However, the long-term impact may have been wildly understated."

    "content": "NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 04: Madonna speaks onstage during the 30th Annual GLAAD Media Awards New  Madonna earned the title of Queen of Pop many years ago, and for decades, she demonstrated her ability to continually change the scene and collect massive hits. Thankfully, she’s not resting on that honorific, and she continues to prove why she’s the greatest female singer in the genre. This week, Madonna scores a new top 10 in the U.K. Her single “Popular,” which is led by The Weeknd and which also features Playboy Carti, advances on the country’s list of the most-consumed songs, breaking into the highest tier for the first time. “Popular” lifts from No. 14, where it fell to last frame, to No. 10. The   notes that “Popular” marks Madonna’s first new top 10 hit in the nation in 15 years. The last time she appeared inside the loftiest tier on the tally was back in 2009. That year, her single “Celebration” climbed to No. 3. Madonna has now scored 64 total top 10 hits throughout her career. As “Popular” rises to No. 10, she extends her lead over all other female musicians for the most top 10 smashes in U.K. history. Somewhat coincidentally, “Popular” hits the top 10 40 years after Madonna earned her first appearance inside the region. Back in 1984, she landed her debut smash in the U.K., with “Holiday.” That single peaked at No. 6. She’d go on to double her total number of wins that year, as “Like a Virgin” also entered the space, stalling at No. 3. “Popular” may be a huge hit in the U.K., but it wasn’t a quick one. The song was first releasded in June of 2023, so it required more than half a year to become a top 10. The track was recorded for The Weeknd’s TV show  , which featured a number of singles from the R&B singer. “Popular” has become the breakout smash from the now-canceled series, but it’s not the only chart win. “One of the Girls” featuring Blackpink member Jennie and actor Lily Rose Depp has also reached the ranking of the top-consumed tunes in the country."

The indicator, calculated by comparing how positive or negative Twitter conversations involving the digital currency are in the short-term (the last 50 days) compared to the long-term (the last 200 days), reached this point today. The chart below shows this development, along with how long-term sentiment has changed over the last several months. This graph depicts fluctuations in long-term sentiment.  While the horizontal axis displays time, the vertical axis shows both the price of bitcoin and the value or “score” of the indicator. Any score above 50 reveals that conversations have been more positive in the short-term than the long-term. Alternatively, a score below 50 points to Twitter conversations that have been less positive over the last 50 days than in the previous 200 days. Recently, the value of this indicator surpassed 90, signaling that sentiment has been significantly more optimistic in the short-term when compared to the long-term. The chart below, which depicts how long-term sentiment has fluctuated over the last several years, helps provide a better sense of the relationship that this measure has with bitcoin prices.

    "title": "Lebanon's Economic Rebirth Through Bitcoin",
    "content": "TOPSHOT - Lebanese demonstrators wave national flags during a demonstration on the sixth day of  According to the  , the situation in Lebanon is regarded as one of the \"most severe global crises since the mid-nineteenth century.\" This has arisen from three decades of imprudent fiscal and monetary policies, leading to the currency's decline by over 95 percent of its value before this downturn. The currency is in a state of collapse, corruption is widespread, and the banking sector is in turmoil. Samar Hawa of   has seen how these challenges have pushed the Lebanese people into difficulty. Reflecting on the nation's resilience, Samar notes, \"The Lebanese, like a Phoenix, rise from the ashes. It's beautiful but sad.\" This sentiment resonates with the mission of Rebirth Beirut, an initiative committed to supporting Lebanon in its time of economic crisis and societal rebuilding. The Lebanese Pound, also known as the Lebanese Lira, has undergone an devastating depreciation, leaving citizens like Samar contending with the erosion of their life savings. As of October 17, 2019, even USD deposits were not spared and transformed into what locals have termed 'Lollars,' a phrase coined by a Lebanese economist. This meant that in practical terms, having $100 in the bank equated to being able to use it as only $10, highlighting the stark devaluation and financial reality facing the country. This situation not only underscores the crippling financial crisis but also serves as a glaring example of third-party risk, as banks faced insolvency after a bank run. It exposes the hazards associated with centralized policymaking that may not always align with the best interests of the people. Despite four years of chaos, Lebanon still lacks a capital control law and effective crisis management measures. In contrast, bitcoin offers a clear alternative with its core principles of self-custody, empowering individuals to access their funds without the need for external permission. Its transparency mitigates the risk of arbitrary policies that could devalue currency, and its immutable and reliable consensus mechanism ensures a decentralized and secure financial system, eliminating the vulnerabilities of a single point of failure and significantly reducing the likelihood of fraud. Photo by Keystone The Lebanese economy, often swayed by political shifts, faced a shock in 2019. The government's proposal to hike taxes on essential services sparked nationwide protests. In response, the banks shut, trapping people's funds and leaving many, except for the few very influential people, mainly the bank owners and the \"Tier 1\" politicians, unable to access their savings. This event led to a significant devaluation of bank deposits, with people's savings losing a considerable portion of their value overnight, plunging the economy towards collapse. The  , which was at 1,500 LBP per dollar in October 2019, had devalued to 141,000 LBP per dollar in March 2023 and stands at around 89,000 LBP per dollar today, witnessing an overall devaluation of approximately 98.5%. For the first time in Lebanon's history, the country defaulted on its debt in March 2020. This was followed by the devastating   on August 4, 2020, which further plunged the country into social and economic distress. Lebanon's public sector, riddled with corruption, has been unable to provide even the most basic services, including proper healthcare, retirement plans, 24-hour electricity, drinkable water - people install large water containers to stock water for times when it is not provided by the government - maintenance of infrastructure, proper waste disposal, and more. Yet, in this darkness, bitcoin offers an interesting use case. Georges Haddad, previously working in Investment Management in Canada, returned to Lebanon following the financial collapse to help rebuild his country and started  , a seed phrase storage solution company that highlights the benefits of self-custody. He sees bitcoin as a solution, \"The moment you start understanding bitcoin, you see how broken money is. It's broken everywhere,\" he states. \"Lebanon, with its deep economic scars, is a testament to the fragility of fiat currencies.\" Many Lebanese remain unbanked or have faced forced de-banking due to the financial crisis. Bitcoin  also addresses the challenge of hoarding cash at home. Those with surplus income and savings have lost trust in the banking system and often need help opening foreign bank accounts due to international regulations. Bitcoin is a hedge against rampant inflation, which has plagued Lebanon in recent years with staggering estimates. It provides a means to circumvent illicit capital controls and restrictions imposed by the banking sector. In this context, stablecoins are used as an interim measure, offering easy access to dollar, serving as a stepping stone amid the crisis. Rebirth Beirut, an initiative born from the rubble, have recently started receiving bitcoin   to help fund their initiatives. These donations help fund projects such as installing cables from private generators to light up the streets. Georges draws parallels between Lebanon's collapse and the potential downfall of larger economies globally, albeit at a slower pace. \"Lebanon could only be five to ten years ahead. It can happen in a blink of an eye,\" he warns. In the past, Lebanon's banking sector was considered a pillar of economic stability, the \"Switzerland of the Middle East.\" But years of mismanagement and corruption have eroded that trust. This combination of pictures created on June 29, 2020 shows the black market rate, as calculated by  This crisis, while unique in its specifics, is symptomatic of a global issue with fiat currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, offers an alternative. Georges envisions a future where bitcoin doesn't just operate as a currency but as a wake-up call to the perils of unchecked money printing and centralization. Georges believes Lebanese expatriates will play an important role due to them being responsible for a large portion of the nation's remittance inflows. With $6 billion a year sent home, bitcoin’s low fees and fast transaction times present an attractive alternative to traditional banking. Lebanon's case is ripe for bitcoin adoption, driven by expatriates and a general distrust of centralized authorities. The country's rich and largely unexploited energy resources – sun, wind, hydro, and potentially gas – offer fertile ground for bitcoin mining. This industry could bring much-needed stability, wealth, and potentially contribute to the decades-long electricity problem. Samar and Georges share a cautious optimism for their homeland. The path forward is fraught with challenges, but the promise of bitcoin and the spirit of the Lebanese people hold the key to a rebirth. \"I am hopeful as a person.\" says Samar, \"While the road ahead presents challenges, I am encouraged by the efforts of   and the private sector which not only contribute to the restoration of infrastructure but also revive hope. This foundation of resilience and innovation instills optimism in me regarding the future.\" In Lebanon's struggle, bitcoin is more than a financial asset; it's a symbol of change, a testament to the power of innovation, and perhaps the country's first step towards a future where the currency is as resilient as its people."

Now it’s emerged that an upgrade is on its way pronto. Apple releases iOS 17.3. The next update is already almost here. As you may know, Apple is releasing an update to its iPhone software in time to meet a deadline from the European Union so it can comply with the Digital Markets Act. While that doesn’t affect anyone outside the EU, there are other elements in the next big update that are useful to all. When Apple releases iOS 17.4, in time for the deadline of March 6, it will have a slew of other features that are worth knowing about. Top of the list is an update to Stolen Device Protection, refining it so that the automatic security delay which currently kicks in when you’re away from a familiar location can be invoked in two different ways. One is the current “Away from Familiar Locations” setting, but you can also choose “Always” so a delay is always required to change security settings. But there are other changes coming your way in iOS 17.4 and it looks like being a huge update. There are new emoji, including a succulent slice of lime, a Smiley face shaking its head yes or no, a mushroom (oh, at last) a flaming phoenix and a chain that is broken in two. This last is useful for comments about the weakest link and so on, for instance. The phoenix would suit a newly resurgent career, while the lime would be good when you have to refer to, er, a lime. There are other new emoji but these are the most striking. There could be a new version of CarPlay coming in iOS 17.4, it seems, and not before time. Podcasts will transcribe spoken words into text, which will be very useful and the text can be copied. Siri will be able to respond to messages it’s reading out in multiple languages. So, when can we expect to see these glorious updates? Since Apple has said that it needs to meet the EU’s deadline of March 8, it’s going to be before then. The Monday of that week is March 4, the Tuesday, therefore is March 5. And that date is my prediction for the release of iOS 17.4. Mark your calendar now."

A judge on Monday ruled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis does not have to sit for a  Willis was   of having a romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade earlier this month, when an attorney for one of Trump’s co-defendants, Michael Roman, filed paperwork seeking her—and Wade’s—disqualification from the case for violating conflict of interest laws and mishandling public money. Roman’s team   the two had an “improper, clandestine personal relationship” before the prosecution began that resulted in Wade being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money for his role as special prosecutor (the attorney cited unnamed sources close to Wade and Willis but didn’t provide concrete evidence). Roman’s attorney also   Wade isn’t qualified for the position Willis appointed him to, arguing he doesn’t have the appropriate background to try the case and hasn’t “prosecuted a single felony trial”—and the New York Times also   Wade’s experience was primarily in low-level criminal cases, and there was no evidence he worked on racketeering cases like the one that ensnared Roman and Trump. The same day the accusation against Willis and Wade was made, Willis was   by the lawyer of Joycelyn Wade, Nathan Wade’s wife, to testify in the couple’s divorce proceedings. Last week,   revealed in the Wades’ divorce case showed Willis and Nathan Wade had taken at least two trips together in 2022 and 2023 for which he paid, something Joycelyn’s team argued has “no reasonable explanation … apart from a romantic relationship.” Joycelyn Wade’s legal team is seeking to   Willis on allegations that she has “unique” information about Wade’s finances, which her lawyer argues are relevant in determining dissipation of assets and spousal support. On Monday, a Cobb County judge ruled to unseal the Wades’ divorce records—which could give insight into Nathan Wade alleged relationship with Willis—but ruled Willis doesn’t need to be deposed in the divorce case, yet,   to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Superior Court Judge Henry Thompson said it appeared that “Wade would be the first and best source of information on what his income has been and how he's been spending it,” ABC News  , adding he would wait to determine whether Willis has “unique personal knowledge” and has to testify until after Wade’s deposition, which is scheduled for next week. Neither Willis nor Nathan Wade have commented on the alleged relationship, but after Roman’s initial filing, a spokesperson for Willis   she would respond “through appropriate court filings.” After allegations first broke, Willis   Nathan Wade at a church service—though she didn’t name him—saying he was “a great friend and a great lawyer.” On Jan. 18, Willis   in which she accused Joycelyn Wade of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution” and trying to “annoy, embarrass and oppress” her. Willis added she shouldn’t have to testify because the Wades’ marriage is “irretrievably broken,” meaning no testimony from her would be “relevant to granting or denying the divorce.” Willis charged Roman, Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their efforts to block the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia in 2020. Trump faces 13 charges, including conspiracy to impersonate a public officer and a violation of Georgia’s racketeering and corrupt organizations (RICO) act—which all Trump co-defendants were charged with. Roman is accused of participating in a plot to appoint fake pro-Trump electors in Georgia. Wade was appointed by Willis to be a special prosecutor on the case, and had previously worked as a prosecutor and a judge, but had little experience prosecuting major criminal cases or cases around the state’s racketeering statute,   to the New York Times. Wade had been a “longtime friend and mentor” to Willis when she hired him, the Times  , and had become someone she could trust with a case as important as the Trump case. $654,000. That’s about how much Nathan Wade has earned in legal fees for his work on the Trump election case, the Journal-Constitution  . Wade was hired to work on the case in November 2021 and was set to be paid an hourly rate of $250,   to the New York Times. How the allegations impact the trial against Trump and his co-defendants. The judge overseeing the trial has   to respond to Roman’s allegations by early February, with a hearing scheduled for Feb. 15. In the meantime, Trump has capitalized on the scandal,   on Truth Social on Jan. 19 that the “lovers” knew he didn’t do anything wrong but “saw Dollar Signs, Fancy Living, and Fame,” so they falsely indicted him. One unnamed Trump adviser told the   the situation was a “gift,” saying they can use the allegations to discredit the case and raise speculation and potentially extend a decision in the case. If Willis, Wade or the DA’s office as a whole are disqualified, the Washington Post   a statewide council of attorneys would be tasked with finding a new prosecutor, which could delay the case significantly. The accusations against Willis and Wade haven’t yet impacted their case against Trump, and some legal analysts don’t think the pair need to be removed—which Roman’s   requested. Three well-known attorneys and critics of Trump—Norm Eisen, Joyce Vance and Richard Painter—penned a piece in   that said a prosecutor can only be disqualified under Georgia law if there is a “conflict of interest” in which the conflicting loyalties could “prejudice the defendant” and lead to “an improper conviction.” Allegations of ethics violations that don’t have anything to do with the trial, the attorneys wrote, cannot be used to get attorneys removed from a case. That said, one of the authors, Eisen, told reporters over the weekend Wade should step aside as the controversy could overshadow and delay the case, the Washington Post  ."

    "content": "Cameras are a key component on every smartphone, and it looks like the next iPhones will see a photographic improvement, at least in the larger version of the Pro iPhone released this fall, the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Here’s what’s coming. Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max: will the iPhone 16 Pro have a bigger camera sensor? According to Weibo user Digital Chat Station, in a report picked up by  , this year’s iPhone 16 Pro Max will have an advanced sensor in the main camera. It’s reported that not only will it be more advanced than the current iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it’ll be bigger, too. That’s important because the race for more megapixels is an empty one unless it’s accompanied by pixels of a decent size. Bigger pixels can draw in more light than smaller ones, so a sensor with the same number of pixels, but bigger ones, can perform better than a similarly sized sensor with a higher pixel count. The new report claims that this year’s Max will be an “image flagship”. I mean, it is already. This report contrasts with other rumors that the Pro and Pro Max would have photographic capabilities that were closer to each other than this year, where the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a 5x zoom in its telephoto, but the iPhone 15 Pro only has room for a 3x zoom. That rumor still stands, that both Pro and Pro Max will have 5x zoom on the telephoto lens. But the Max, it seems, will still outstrip the regular Pro photographically, this time on the main camera sensor. The pixel count, the report claims, will stay at 48 megapixels for both phones. But the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a stacked design, which promises better performance. There’ll be a better Analog to Digital Converter and better noise control. Most important of all, the sensor size will increase from the 1/1.28 inch sensor found on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro, to a 1/1.14 inch sensor. That 12% size increase could promise significantly improved low-light performance, as well as greater dynamic range and improved background blur for better bokeh effects. This could all be done without increasing the thickness of the phone. More details will leak, but this is a promising upgrade for all iPhone users who enjoy taking the best photographs with the least effort."

Former President Donald Trump leaves his apartment building in New York on Jan. 22, to attend his  After a brief deliberation Friday afternoon the jury returned a verdict saying Trump must pay $83.3 million in damages, including a $65 million award for punitive damages and $18.3 million in compensatory damages. Carroll first sued Trump in November 2019, accusing the then-president of defamation after he denied her allegations of sexual assault, claiming Carroll wasn’t “my type.” She filed a second lawsuit in November 2022 alleging defamation and sexual assault, which went to trial first in May 2023, with the jury ruling Trump did assault and defame Carroll—but did not rape her. Given that Trump had already been found liable for defamation and sexual assault—the second lawsuit was based on different but substantially similar comments he made about Carroll—this trial was only to determine damages, and began Jan. 16. Trump has already appealed the verdict against him in Carroll’s first trial, and could likely do the same with this ruling. He’ll still have to turn over the money first, however, as he did in the first case,   the sum into a court-controlled account while the case is being appealed. The ex-president has continued to attack Carroll on social media in recent weeks and months—posting about her   on Monday alone—though it remains to be seen if Carroll has any intention of filing another defamation claim against Trump for his more recent posts. Forbes has estimated Trump’s   at $2.6 billion as of October, with an estimated $426 million in cash and liquid assets. It’s unclear whether he’ll be drawing from those reserves for his payout to Carroll or pay through his Save America PAC, which has been handling the lion’s share of his legal fees—though that group   having only $3.7 million in cash on hand as of June 30. This may be the first of two big payments Trump will be ordered to make in cases against him this month, as Judge Arthur Engoron is also expected to imminently issue a verdict in the ex-president’s separate  . New York Attorney General Letitia James brought that case against Trump and his company, alleging the ex-president and his associates fraudulently misstated the value of assets on financial statements for personal gain. The case went to trial starting in October, and Engoron has said he’ll likely issue his verdict by the end of January.

    "content": "A Greek air force C-130. As the Republican Party’s blockade of aid to Ukraine drags into its fourth month, the U.S. government under Pres. Joe Biden has found a clever new way to give Ukraine’s forces the weapons and ammunition they need to defend their country. It is, in essence, an American version of Germany’s circular weapons trade— . The United States is gifting older surplus weapons to Greece with the understanding that Greece donates to Ukraine some of its  surplus weapons. Greek media broke the news last week. According to the newspaper  and other media, the Biden administration offered the Greek government three 87-foot  -class patrol boats, two Lockheed Martin C-130H airlifters, 10 Allison T56 turboprop engines for Lockheed P-3 patrol planes plus 60 M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and a consignment of transport trucks. All this hardware is U.S. military surplus—and is available to Greece, free of charge, under a U.S. legal authority called   Federal law allows an American president to declare military systems surplus to need, assign them a value—potentially zero dollars—and give them away on the condition that the recipient transport them. The law caps annual EDA transfers at $500 million. The same law   dictate the  the president assigns to surplus weapons. In a letter to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken   the ships, planes, engines and vehicles as “free concessions.” The EDA gifts to Greece sweeten a larger arms package that includes 40 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, which Greece is buying for $8.6 billion. The Biden administration previously approved, in 2022 and 2023, $60 million in financing for arms-purchases by Athens. In exchange for this largess, the Americans want the Greeks to donate more weapons to the Ukrainians. “We continue to be interested in the defense capabilities that Greece could transfer or sell to Ukraine,” Blinken wrote. The Americans even offered a reward once the donation is complete. “If these capabilities are of interest to Ukraine, and pending an assessment of their status and value by the U.S. government, we can explore opportunities for possible additional foreign armed forces financing of up to $200 million for Greece.” The Greek military operates, or holds in storage, an array of Soviet- and U.S.-designed weaponry that would be of immediate value to the Ukrainian military—in particular, S-300 and Hawk long-range air-defense batteries, Tor and Osa short-range air-defense vehicles and ZU-23-2 air-defense guns. Also: ammunition for all these systems. Some or all of those weapons could be heading to Ukraine. “Political and military leadership has already given the necessary directions so that obsolete systems and equipment that are no longer used by the Greek army are transferred to Ukraine,”  . The Greek ring-transfer was a delicate one, as tensions between Greece and Turkey mean the United States usually offers both countries new weapons at the same time—and in roughly the same quantity. So it’s no accident that, simultaneous with the Greek arms deal, the U.S. State Department cleared Turkey to spend $23 billion on 40 new Lockheed F-16 fighters and 79 upgrade kits for older F-16s, plus munitions for the fighters. The deal also was a reward for Turkey finally consenting to Sweden joining NATO. Germany’s  program has speeded to Ukraine scores of tanks and other heavy weapons. America’s  ring trade could do the same—potentially on an even grander scale. Greece isn’t the only country with old weapons that it might give away, if the United States offers something in return. That Biden and his secretary of state Blinken are backing an EDA-based ring-trade should come as no surprise to close observers of American politics. Last fall, pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress made it clear they probably never will approve direct military aid to Ukraine. The Republicans are falling in line with disgraced ex-president Donald Trump’s personal hatred of Ukraine—and equally personal fondness for authoritarian Russia. The Republicans’ allegiance to Trump—and therefore to dictators and military aggressors—wasn’t an issue for Ukraine until they narrowly gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2022 elections. When earlier funding for Ukraine ran out in late December, Rep. Mike Johnson—the extremist House speaker—refused to put additional aid to a vote. So barring a legislative breakthrough, Biden can’t get the additional $61 billion in clean funding he wants for Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean he can’t honor the wishes of the majority of Americans and help Ukraine to defend itself. Biden’s EDA authority is one of several legal mechanisms at his disposal that can free up older weapons for onward transfer to Ukraine. And while Biden could send excess defense articles directly to Ukraine, he initially is using EDA as leverage in ring trades. Expect more of this as Republicans and Trump increasingly side with Russia in Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine. The Republicans might be eager to betray Ukraine; Biden however  ."

    "title": "As Ukraine Runs Out Of Ammo, Russian Artillery Gunners Get Cocky",
    "content": "A Ukrainian 2S3 howitzer. When U.S. aid to Ukraine ran out in late December and pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress refused to vote on Pres. Joe Biden’s proposal to spend another $61 billion on the war effort, Ukraine’s artillery batteries were the first to feel this betrayal. That’s because American had been one of the biggest donors of howitzers and rocket-launchers—and ammunition for both. Where as recently as this summer, Ukraine’s artillery enjoyed parity with, if not superiority over, Russia’s own artillery, today the Russians have a fivefold advantage. Ukrainian batteries fire around 2,000 shells a day. Russian batteries fire 10,000. And as a result, Russian gunners are getting cocky. Unworried by the risk of Ukrainian gunners firing back at them, the Russians are concentrating their biggest guns and launchers for devastating salvos targeting Ukrainian positions in front-line cities. Ukrainian analysis group Frontelligence Insight   in satellite imagery of the 600-mile front line of Russia’s 23-month wider war on Ukraine. “In January alone, Frontelligence Insight recorded over 14 concentrations of artillery and enemy forces,” the group reported. “Our analysis suggests that this resurgence signals a decreasing fear among Russian forces, possibly fueled by renewed ammunition shortages on the Ukrainian side.” The group highlighted one cluster of nearly 20 revetments for artillery or other vehicles outside Lysychansk, five miles from the line of contact in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk Oblast. A year ago, the Russians probably wouldn’t have risked clustering so much heavy weaponry out in the open in such a small area so close to the front. Ukraine’s M777 howitzers and High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, respectively ranging 15 and 57 miles, might’ve blasted the Russians into oblivion. But with artillery and rocket ammo dwindling, the Ukrainian military is saving what shells and rockets it has for the direst emergencies: striking Russian troops and their vehicles as they’re about to break through Ukrainian lines. “Regrettably, this situation empowers Russia to execute a well-known approach,” Frontelligence Insight explained. “The systematic destruction of urban areas, rendering them indefensible.” The group pointed to Marinka, a city in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian troops held out in Marinka for nearly two years. But as their ammo ran low, Russian artillery was able to mass for a devastating bombardment. In late December, Russian guns “systematically obliterated the entire city, leaving almost no trace of any structure or dwelling,” Frontelligence Insight recalled. The Ukrainian garrison had nowhere left to hide. It retreated to the west—and handed Russia a propaganda victory. “The relentless bombardment reduced Marinka to complete oblivion, only for the aggressors to subsequently claim liberation.” Closer to the front, Ukrainian brigades have compensated for their artillery starvation by flinging more and more explosive first-person-view drones— —at attacking Russian regiments. But a typical radio-controlled FPV drone, weighing two pounds and hauling a one-pound grenade, ranges just two miles or so. “Based on our observations, numerous artillery pieces are positioned at distances ranging from 15 to 24 kilometers [nine to 15 miles] away from the front line, rendering them beyond the practical reach of the majority of small FPVs.” The imminent arrival of Ukraine’s new Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs—rocket-boosted glide-munitions that the United States paid for early last year—could weigh on Russia’s firepower advantage. A GPS-guided GLSDB ranges more than 90 miles. But we don’t know how many GLSDBs Ukraine is getting—or how it might deploy them. “The potential introduction of GLSDB to Ukraine could indeed mark a significant turning point,” Frontelligence Insight conceded, “although it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions—especially considering the untested nature of this weaponry in a large-scale conventional conflict. The surest way for Ukraine to restore artillery parity, prevent the demolition of more cities and turn Russian gunners’ growing complacency against them also is the most obvious. Somehow acquire more shells and rockets for its howitzers and launchers. Just don’t count on the Americans. While Biden   to donate surplus American weapons without first seeking Congressional approval, it’s not clear that authority applies to ammunition."

    "title": "Russia Deployed Jammers To Beat Ukraine’s Drones, But They Don’t Work",
    "content": "A Russian MT-LB, fitted with an RP-377 jammer, burns. A Russian mechanized assault in the vicinity of Novomykhailivka, 10 miles west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, should sound alarms in the Kremlin. The Tuesday assault was small—just three T-72 tanks, seven MT-LB armored tractors and a single BMP-2 fighting vehicle, possibly from the Russian army’s 20th Motor Rifle Division. And its total destruction by Ukrainian drones in the span of three hours isn’t terribly unusual.  Russian attacks end in drone-inflicted defeat. No, what should worry Russian commanders is that the Ukrainian drones, apparently from the 79th Air Assault Brigade or the 7th Ranger Battalion, were unbothered by the electronic-warfare gear the Russians usually attach to their vehicles right before an attack. The E.W. systems broadcast radio noise that, in theory, should scramble the signals by which drone-operators control their two-pound, two-mile-range first-person-view drones, each laden with a pound of explosives. But during the Tuesday assault, any defensive jamming failed—and the drones swiftly demolished the Russian column. Russian forces “do not have any massive protection against enemy drones,” one Russian blogger complained in a missive   @wartranslated. “Everything they install has long been outdated and does not cover the enemy’s new frequencies.” For friends of a free Ukraine, this is good news. With pro-Russian Republicans in the U.S. Congress blockading U.S. aid to Ukraine, Kyiv’s artillery batteries are starved for ammunition: they’re firing just 2,000 rounds a day, a fifth what Russian batteries can fire. So Ukrainian troops are replacing artillery with FPV drones, which don’t require precision manufacturing and might cost just a few hundred dollars apiece. Ukraine is building, and flinging at Russian forces,  . Jamming has been Russia’s best defense against the swarm of Ukrainian drones, just as it’s been   best defense against a equally dense swarm of  drones. The difference is that Ukrainian jamming apparently still works. Russian jamming, on the other hand, may be failing. “The problem requires emergency measures,” the blogger intoned. As FPV drones replaced artillery as the most serious threat to Russian ground forces late last year, the Russian military responded by bolting, to its armored vehicles, whatever radio-jammers were available:   and   that magnetically stick to the outside of a tank. There was some risk the jammers would thwart Ukrainian drone operations. “I saw the spectrograms,” Ukrainian drone expert Serhii Beskrestnov wrote after inspecting a captured RP-377. “The interference is very high quality.” If that happened, it didn’t happen for long. Today Ukrainian drones are flying everywhere, all the time, along the 600-mile front of Russia’s wider war on Ukraine. While it helps that Ukrainian drone-operators   Russia’s most powerful fixed jammers, it may be even  helpful to Ukraine’s war effort that the shorter-range mobile jammers—Russian troops’ last-ditch defenses—seemingly aren’t jamming much of anything anymore. Maybe the blogger is right, and Ukrainian operators are hopping frequencies in order to dodge Russian jamming. Or maybe there’s some other trick, such as a built-in artificial intelligence that briefly takes over control of a drone when its human controller gets jammed. In any event, the Ukrainians seem to have found a viable approach to defensive firepower that buys them some time as their allies scramble to provide more artillery ammo—and as U.S. president Joe Biden   that allow him to overcome pro-Russia Republicans’ opposition to Ukraine’s self-defense. “It looks like this is the strategy of the Ukrainian armed forces,” a second Russian blogger  . “Going on the defensive, using drones, fairy tales about a shortage of shells.” Ukraine’s shell-shortage is real, in fact. But so is its drone-first approach to ground warfare. As Ukraine ramped up robotic strikes, Russia gambled on jammers to protect its troops. It seems to have been a losing bet."

Lawyer Alina Habba (R) looks on as former President Donald Trump attends the third day of his civil  Trump was   to pay $83.3 million in damages for defaming Carroll based on statements he made in 2019 denying her allegations of sexual assault, as he claimed the writer wasn’t “my type.” Trump intends to appeal the verdict, and said on Truth Social Tuesday he and his team were “in the process” of interviewing “various law firms” to represent him as he appeals what he described as “one of the most ridiculous and unfair Witch Hunts our Country has ever seen.” The ex-president was represented at the initial trial by attorney Alina Habba—who also represents him in the   against him and his company, and in other cases—who was   by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan at the trial and had to be reminded of basic courtroom procedures. Following the trial verdict, Habba   with the court alleging Kaplan had an improper bias in the case, citing a New York Post report on his previous work at the same firm as Carroll’s attorney Roberta Kaplan (no relation) that claimed he mentored the lawyer—which legal experts   wouldn’t constitute a conflict of interest that would require him to recuse. Roberta Kaplan denied the claims the judge mentored her as “baseless” in a court filing Tuesday—noting she and the judge had only overlapped at the same firm for two years and never interacted in that time—and suggested she could ask the court to sanction Habba for making the claim, to which Habba then   she was just trying to ask if there was any truth to the Post report and would drop the issue. Habba’s law firm Habba Madaio & Associates and Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung have not yet responded to requests for comment on Trump’s Truth Social post and whether Habba will stay on as Trump’s attorney in the appeal. “Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either ‘CRAZY,’ or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday night. Trump said on Truth Social Tuesday he would “make my decision soon” on his legal representation. It’s unclear when exactly Trump will formally file his appeal in the Carroll case, though it’s likely to come soon after the judge submits a written verdict to the court. The appeal isn’t likely to get the ex-president out of paying the $83.3 million at least for now, however: Trump was previously ordered to pay $5 million in his first trial against Carroll (based on similar but separate statements about her), which he’s had to put into a court-controlled   while he appeals the verdict. Carroll sued Trump in Nov. 2021, accusing him of defamation after he attacked her when she came out with allegations against him, claiming Trump raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. A jury in the first case against Trump—which was brought in Nov. 2022 but went to trial first—found the ex-president liable for defamation and battery, but not rape, and the jury in the most recent trial only had to determine how much in damages Trump had to pay Carroll. They reached their verdict of $83.3 million only a few hours after deliberations began. Habba   as one of Trump’s attorneys in 2021, and while the New Jersey-based lawyer didn’t have high-profile experience beforehand—she previously served as the counsel for a parking garage—she’s become one of Trump’s key lawyers and one of his most outspoken advocates in the press, adopting his combative rhetoric and blasting his political enemies. Her lack of trial experience was betrayed during the Carroll trial, however, when Judge Kaplan had to make such   as directing her how to introduce and mark up evidence and chide her for speaking about materials she hadn’t entered into evidence. Should she now face sanctions in the Carroll case, it would come after she and Trump were previously   to pay nearly $1 million in sanctions in the ex-president’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.

Android Circuit is here to remind you of a few of the many discussions around Android in the last seven days. You can also  . With the Samsung Galaxy S24 family now on sale, more reviews and analyses on the three core handsets are published. The ever-popular DXOMark has performed its usual camera-focused review on the latest hardware, and the S24 Ultra has come into sharp focus. The hardware has seen some improvements, but the addition of AI into the software has the biggest impact: \"The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra delivered a decent performance in the DXOMARK Camera tests and was a slight overall improvement over its predecessor S23 Ultra, helped by a 200MP image sensor in the main camera, a range of new AI features, and the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset... It’s difficult to tell to which degree the AI exactly contributes to image quality, but it certainly appears that the new AI tools and Samsung’s existing imaging technologies have helped to greatly improve the rendering of some images.\" ( ). The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) With the Galaxy S24 family now launched, the focus will turn to the foldable Galaxy Handsets that are typically launched in late July, six months after (or six months before, if you prefer) the traditional “S” handsets. But there may be something joining the expensive and presumptively-named Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6… an affordable foldable to bring the new technology to a wider consumer market. \"Samsung has three codenames in play for its next set of foldable smartphones. “Q6” and “B6” directly follow up with the “Q5” and “B5” of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5... Alongside those codenames is also “Q6A,” which points to a second variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6. That’s highly likely to be this more affordable version we’ve been hearing about, and the use of “A” in the codename only adds fuel to the fire given Samsung’s budget-conscious lineup is called “Galaxy A.”\" (  via  ). One of the key features that premiered at Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event was the “Circle To Search” function. Presented by Google, a simple highlighting of an object on the screen would be searched for. This isn’t a Samsung exclusive, though, as the feature is now available on the latest Pixel handsets through an over-the-air update. \"If you have gesture navigation enabled, long-press on the nav handle to invoke Circle to Search. Those that use 3-button nav, can do the same with the home button, but will lose the ability to launch Google Assistant that way. (Instead, they have to use the hotword, power button, or homescreen app icon, while the   is no longer available.) \" ( ). 4  With the marquee Mobile World Congress event later this month, manufacturers will use the moment to launch new phones and demonstrate cutting-edge technologies. Honor will be one of the companies doing the former, bringing its latest phones to the stage and hopefully answering a few lingering questions about its flagship candybar and foldable: \"HONOR’s showcase is no mystery. The brand has taken to X (formerly Twiter) to confirm that it’ll be bringing the Magic 6 series and the Magic V2 series to the event. Both devices have already been announced, but we’re guessing we’ll hear more about their global availability at MWC.\" ( ). Xiaomi has brought several key features to the mid-range with the Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G (as well as a rather wordy name); both the camera hardware and the crisp AMOLED display stand out. Yet there are some features further down the specs list that is appealing to its target market. \"The light case and its slim bezels are a standout and the display is protected from damage thanks to Gorilla Glass Victus. The generous storage options (up to 512 GB UFS 2.2 flash), the 3.5mm audio jack connector and an IR blaster are also (still) something special in this price segment.\" ( ). Tucked away at the end of Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event, as part of the presentation on health and wellbeing, was confirmation of the Galaxy Ring, albeit with scant details. Forbes’ Jay McGregor looks at the potential for Samsung’s wearable through his experience with the leading hardware in the space: \"The unknown quantity of how Samsung will deploy AI in the Galaxy Ring is the most intriguing part of the new device. The high likelihood of aggressive pricing also will make the wearable accessible. But, most importantly, the competition will follow suit and the smart ring market will grow very quickly over the next two years, which is only good news for consumers\" ( ). With Apple’s App Store in the news thanks to the demands for a more open approach by Europe, it’s worth checking out a recent interview with Google Play’s General Manager Sam Bright: \"I asked Bright about this ongoing reputation, which persists into 2024, that Android apps are still not up to the same quality standards as their iOS counterparts, and he said that Google shares that responsibility with developers. “People take their impressions of [Google] Play from the Android apps they use, so there’s a shared responsibility to make sure those impressions are what would make us all proud.” He tells me that, from his perspective, there are no impediments, from the development tools to the distribution opportunities, to developers creating apps of the same quality and revenue potential as their App Store equivalents.\" ( ).

Harley Quinn and Batman exchange words, with Harley giving Batman a piece of her mind; amusingly, she even accuses him of “causing long-term mental and emotional damage to everyone you knew.” It should be noted that in this story, Harley Quinn hasn’t dumped the abusive Joker as she often does in other versions— her Joker is dead, and she has been seeking revenge on Batman for some time. Batman asks Harley if she’s done with her \"bad stand up routine,\" and Harley replies that you always have to “end on your best joke\" before shooting Batman in the head, at point-blank range. That’s it — that’s the death of Batman. Specifically, the Batman featured in the  game series, which was largely beloved by gamers. The scene seems to be deliberately anti-climatic and subversive, with Harley gloating, “bet you didn't think it'd be me at the end, huh Bats?” The controversial cutscene has been  , and has sparked heated discourse among DC and Batman fans. Initially, Batman fans were  that that this grisly cutscene appeared to be the final performance of the legendary Kevin Conroy, who has been voicing Batman for decades across multiple mediums. Conroy is best-known for his performance in  , and is widely considered by fans to be the definitive voice of Batman. Following a battle with cancer, Conroy tragically passed away in 2022, at age 66. Hence, many fans found this portrayal of the character to be in poor taste. IGN has since  that   isn’t actually Conroy’s final Batman performance. Not to mention, Conroy himself chose to take the role — this wasn’t some ghoulish, AI-generated imitation of his voice. According to game director Axel Rydby, Conroy had no issues with the depiction of Batman. In an interview with  , Rydby said that Conroy “really enjoyed his performance in the game, and that was important to us that it felt like he liked what we were doing with the character as well.\" Otherwise, some fans have taken issue with the “disrespectful” tone toward the character of Batman. Fans of the  game franchise are disappointed that this underwhelming death at the hands of a relatively under-powered villain is the final fate of  Batman. However, this isn’t the first time Harley Quinn has bested Batman. In the “Mad Love” episode of animated series  , Harley successfully captures Batman and come surprisingly close to killing him. In an ironic twist, Batman is saved by the Joker, who is furious that his sidekick/girlfriend managed to capture his arch-nemesis. On social media, many fans were unhappy that the death of Batman was portrayed in an edgy cutscene that belittles the character — some were also  that the Flash was murdered and urinated on by a member of the Suicide Squad. Others mocked the backlash, pointing out that the game is literally titled “Kill the Justice League” and compared the tone of the game to an irreverent, edgy comedy like Deadpool. Generally, fans seem unhappy that   didn’t show Batman escaping through a clever back-up plan, or a deus ex machina, as the character traditionally would. One X (Twitter) user pointed out that the backlash was bad for storytelling,  : “gamers throwing a fit every time a popular character dies ensures that future games will be repetitive nostalgia fodder where nothing interesting can ever happen.” Of course, superheroes are killed (and revived) all the time in comic books, but fans don’t seem to appreciate an underwhelming defeat. In 2007, many Captain America fans expressed disappointment after Marvel unceremoniously  the character via a bullet from a sniper rifle. Much of the backlash to   was sparked by the quiet, unexpected death of Luke Skywalker, while the dramatic, heroic “deaths” of multiple Avengers in  were largely praised by fans. It’s unknown if the death of this Batman will be reversed somehow, via time travel, multiverse shenanigans, or some other convoluted plot twist."

Close-up of a Black person using a pulse oximeter to check their blood oxygen saturation level and  Pulse oximeters are devices usually placed on the tip of the finger and used to measure oxygen levels in the blood, and are typically used on people experiencing shortness of breath, or people with lung or heart conditions,   to the American Lung Association. Because the use of pulse oximeters by patients at home and in hospitals by healthcare providers increased due to the Covid pandemic, the FDA released a   in 2021 warning people that although the devices are useful, they have their limitations. Some factors that may affect the accuracy of the devices’ readings are skin color, nail polish, ambient lighting, dyes or tattoos and severe anemia, James Lee, division director of the FDA’s Division of Sleep Disordered Breathing, Respiratory and Anesthesia Devices   during the meeting. Over 20 state attorneys general sent a   in November 2023 urging the FDA to update its guidelines to include warnings that address pulse oximetry’s inaccuracy on darker skin to “prevent additional severe illness and mortalities among darker skinned people.” Research has shown darker skin tones receive more inaccurate readings than lighter ones: 11.7% of apparently normal readings in Black patients were wrong, compared to 3.6% of readings in white patients, a 2020 New England Journal of Medicine  found. “We must keep in the forefront of our minds that this is a significant health equity issue,” Scott Lucas, vice president of device safety at nonprofit healthcare organization ECRI, said during the meeting. “The color of a patient’s skin should never degrade the quality or the effectiveness of tools that healthcare providers use to give lifesaving care.” Pulse oximeters are typically clipped onto a patient’s finger, and work by emitting light that passes through the skin, tissue and blood to the other side of the sensor,   to Yale Medicine. The sensor detects how much light passes through without being absorbed, and that measurement determines the blood oxygen levels. The devices are more inaccurate on darker skin tones because higher levels of melanin absorb higher levels of light, which limit the light’s ability to penetrate through the skin, a 2022 Sensors   found. Black patients have higher odds of having low blood oxygen noted in their blood-drawn readings than white patients, according to a separate 2022   published in BMJ. The use of pulse oximeters increased during the Covid pandemic because they’re used to   how severe the disease is. Compared to white patients, pulse oximeters overestimated blood oxygen levels by an average of 1.7% in Asian patients, 1.2% in Black patients and 1.1% in Hispanic patients, a 2022 JAMA Internal Medicine   found. These incorrect readings led to a delay in minorities receiving certain treatments for Covid, which researchers believe contributed to worse health outcomes in minorities during the pandemic.

    "content": "A Greek air force C-130. As the Republican Party’s blockade of aid to Ukraine drags into its fourth month, the U.S. government under Pres. Joe Biden has found a clever new way to give Ukraine’s forces the weapons and ammunition they need to defend their country. It is, in essence, an American version of Germany’s circular weapons trade— . The United States is gifting older surplus weapons to Greece with the understanding that Greece donates to Ukraine some of its  surplus weapons. Greek media broke the news last week. According to the newspaper  and other media, the Biden administration offered the Greek government three 87-foot  -class patrol boats, two Lockheed Martin C-130H airlifters, 10 Allison T56 turboprop engines for Lockheed P-3 patrol planes plus 60 M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles and a consignment of transport trucks. All this hardware is U.S. military surplus—and is available to Greece, free of charge, under a U.S. legal authority called   Federal law allows an American president to declare military systems surplus to need, assign them a value—potentially zero dollars—and give them away on the condition that the recipient transport them. The law caps annual EDA transfers at $500 million. The same law   dictate the  the president assigns to surplus weapons. In a letter to Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken   the ships, planes, engines and vehicles as “free concessions.” The EDA gifts to Greece sweeten a larger arms package that includes 40 Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, which Greece is buying for $8.6 billion. The Biden administration previously approved, in 2022 and 2023, $60 million in financing for arms-purchases by Athens. In exchange for this largess, the Americans want the Greeks to donate more weapons to the Ukrainians. “We continue to be interested in the defense capabilities that Greece could transfer or sell to Ukraine,” Blinken wrote. The Americans even offered a reward once the donation is complete. “If these capabilities are of interest to Ukraine, and pending an assessment of their status and value by the U.S. government, we can explore opportunities for possible additional foreign armed forces financing of up to $200 million for Greece.” The Greek military operates, or holds in storage, an array of Soviet- and U.S.-designed weaponry that would be of immediate value to the Ukrainian military—in particular, S-300 and Hawk long-range air-defense batteries, Tor and Osa short-range air-defense vehicles and ZU-23-2 air-defense guns. Also: ammunition for all these systems. Some or all of those weapons could be heading to Ukraine. “Political and military leadership has already given the necessary directions so that obsolete systems and equipment that are no longer used by the Greek army are transferred to Ukraine,”  . The Greek ring-transfer was a delicate one, as tensions between Greece and Turkey mean the United States usually offers both countries new weapons at the same time—and in roughly the same quantity. So it’s no accident that, simultaneous with the Greek arms deal, the U.S. State Department cleared Turkey to spend $23 billion on 40 new Lockheed F-16 fighters and 79 upgrade kits for older F-16s, plus munitions for the fighters. The deal also was a reward for Turkey finally consenting to Sweden joining NATO. Germany’s  program has speeded to Ukraine scores of tanks and other heavy weapons. America’s  ring trade could do the same—potentially on an even grander scale. Greece isn’t the only country with old weapons that it might give away, if the United States offers something in return. That Biden and his secretary of state Blinken are backing an EDA-based ring-trade should come as no surprise to close observers of American politics. Last fall, pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress made it clear they probably never will approve direct military aid to Ukraine. The Republicans are falling in line with disgraced ex-president Donald Trump’s personal hatred of Ukraine—and equally personal fondness for authoritarian Russia. The Republicans’ allegiance to Trump—and therefore to dictators and military aggressors—wasn’t an issue for Ukraine until they narrowly gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November 2022 elections. When earlier funding for Ukraine ran out in late December, Rep. Mike Johnson—the extremist House speaker—refused to put additional aid to a vote. So barring a legislative breakthrough, Biden can’t get the additional $61 billion in clean funding he wants for Ukraine. But that doesn’t mean he can’t honor the wishes of the majority of Americans and help Ukraine to defend itself. Biden’s EDA authority is one of several legal mechanisms at his disposal that can free up older weapons for onward transfer to Ukraine. And while Biden could send excess defense articles directly to Ukraine, he initially is using EDA as leverage in ring trades. Expect more of this as Republicans and Trump increasingly side with Russia in Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine. The Republicans might be eager to betray Ukraine; Biden however  ."

    "content": "Surplus M-1 tanks at the Sierra Army Depot in California. Pro-Russia Republicans in the U.S. Congress for months have been withholding $61 billion in vital military aid to Ukraine. They’ve been betting that, by linking a fresh round of aid to unprecedented restrictions on immigration and asylum, they can either: get U.S. president Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers to agree to a raft of new xenophobic policies; or at least sow political chaos that they believe will benefit them in upcoming elections. But Republicans aren’t “negotiating”—or, more accurately, “extorting”—from a position of strength. Because Biden has a   veto over  veto of aid to Ukraine. One he either doesn’t yet fully appreciate or, more likely, is saving for an emergency. It’s a classification for older weaponry the U.S. government calls   or EDA. The government has the legal authority to sell extremely cheaply—or even give away—any U.S. military hardware that U.S. forces no longer need. Biden only rarely has used his EDA authority to send weapons to Ukraine. Instead, he has leaned more heavily on his separate Presidential Drawdown Authority to send to Ukraine newer weapons that U.S. forces otherwise still might use. But the way Biden has used PDA requires the Pentagon immediately to pay for replacement weapons for its own forces. It’s money for those replacements—as well as financing for other arms production for Ukraine—that Biden largely is asking for in his supplemental funding proposal. All that is to say, Biden needs Republicans if he’s going to continue supporting Ukraine via his drawdown authority. He   need Republicans if he instead falls back on his  authority. EDA might be the,  , trump card that Biden is saving in this escalating political game. A game where, tragically, the stakes are Ukrainian lives. U.S. president Joe Biden perhaps was optimistic when, last fall, he proposed to federal lawmakers a $106-billion supplemental spending bill that would fund military aid to Taiwan, Israel and—to the tune of $61 billion—Ukraine. When Democrats from Biden’s own political party fully controlled Congress, approval might’ve been swift. But Republicans gained narrow control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the mid-term election in November 2022. Increasingly under the sway of authoritarians including disgraced former U.S. president Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, House Republicans refused to approve the funding. And holding hands with fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate, they tied further aid to Ukraine to immigration and border “reforms.” In short, the Republicans demanded more arrests and less immigration across the border. Biden swiftly signaled he would accept new restrictions along the border if that freed up aid to Ukraine. A trio of U.S. senators—one Republican, one Democrat and an independent—began negotiating a border and immigration bill. The gang of three senators could release the text of the bill as soon as this week. But the speaker of the House, Louisiana Republic Mike Johnson—a political novice who backed Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost—denounced the new bill even before he read it. \"I don't think now is the time for comprehensive immigration reform because we know how complicated that is,” Johnson  , even though  was one of the Republican leaders who  comprehensive immigration reform as a condition of further aiding Ukraine. Barring some unlikely cross-party alliances, Johnson alone can bring a bill to a vote in the House. Apparently growing impatient, Biden called Johnson and other Congressional leaders to a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, the main subject of which was Ukraine. Johnson emerged less strident than when he entered. “We understand the necessity about Ukraine funding,” he  . We don’t know what Biden said to Johnson, but it’s possible he explained that there still are legal tools at Biden’s disposal for sending military aid to Ukraine—tools that don’t require Johnson and his party to do  . It’s possible, in other words, that Biden played the EDA card—and emphasized to Johnson that there are two potential outcomes as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds toward its third year and Ukrainian troops run low on weaponry. One, Johnson and his fellow Republicans can trade new border policies for $61 billion in Ukraine aid and “win” this political game. Or they can withhold aid, compel Biden to lean on his EDA authority and get nothing in return as fresh aid begins to flow. The list of military hardware Biden could donate or sell cheaply to Ukraine is a long one. It grows longer if Ukraine can tap financing from its European allies in order to pay a higher premium for older American weapons. The list includes tanks,  , trucks, naval patrol boats and even retired F-16 fighters. Enough weaponry to keep Ukrainian forces in the fight for years.   , but they’re ... fungible. The president can give away old weapons that have no commercial value, but the recipient has to pay for shipping. The law also limits the total annual value of EDA transfers to just $500 million. But the same law   strictly dictate how government officials value a particular excess weapon. If the Biden administration decides, say,  —thousands of which are in storage in U.S Army arsenals—is worth just a few thousand dollars, there’s not much that lawmakers can do to stop Biden from sending hundreds of M-1s to Ukraine on trains and ships that Ukraine charters. If Republicans have healthy political instincts, they’ll vote for the forthcoming Senate immigration compromise and unlock aid to Ukraine. If they   have healthy political instincts, and Biden  , the next big batches of American weapons for Ukraine could come from the vast stocks of Excess Defense Articles."

Trump’s lawyers previously  a request for documents they claimed showed the basis of the investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents was “politically motivated.” But in a 67-page   to the motion Friday, argued against the request, claiming Trump’s motion seeks records “based on speculative, unsupported, and false theories of political bias and animus.” Smith’s team also took the   of using the filing to lay out a lengthy rebuttal against claims of political bias, claiming Trump’s motion “paints an inaccurate and distorted picture of events” that, if unanswered, “leave a highly misleading impression on a number of matters.” Smith argued Trump and his co-defendants “cherry-pick exhibits” and “selectively quote” from documents to put a “nefarious gloss on innocuous events” leading up to Trump’s prosecution—instead, Smith argued, Trump’s prosecution was the product of “responsible actions by government officials diligently doing their jobs” in trying to collect documents from Trump that “as a matter of law, belong to the United States.” On Truth Social on Saturday, Trump didn’t reference the filing specifically, but reasserted claims of political bias, taking aim at “Deranged Jack Smith,” as well as the prosecutors leading other criminal cases against him, calling them “(President Joe) Biden prosecutors,” leading “Biden’s investigations for purposes of ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” Forbes has contacted Trump’s legal team for comment. Among other things, Trump’s legal team has argued that officials at the National Archives made a “sham” criminal referral to the Justice Department that cited communication with Biden administration officials that ultimately kicked off the prosecution. Smith’s team rejected those claims Friday, asserting the referral was “entirely consistent\" with the government’s interest in retaining “national defense information.” The filing quoted Trump’s  : “In my administration, I’m going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.” Smith argued the communications between Archives officials and the Department of Justice were not suspicious because concerns about Trump’s keeping of classified records “had mounted for months.” Trump and co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira face a slew of charges in the documents case—including 37 counts against Trump of violating the Espionage Act, conspiring to obstruct justice and lying to investigators. The case centers on Trump’s alleged storing of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and alleged failure to cooperate with government officials who were trying to retain those documents. But Trump has long lashed out against the prosecution—and other criminal and civil cases out of Georgia and New York—as political witch hunts ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Trump faces dozens of charges across —in addition to the classified documents case, he’s been charged with racketeering in Georgia for his alleged efforts to pressure officials into overturning the 2020 election results. He’s also been charged in New York for allegedly covering up campaign finance violations by signing non-disclosure agreements over a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels and charged by Smith in another federal case for allegedly disrupting official proceedings by stoking the protests that led to the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump’s prosecution in Georgia is facing headwinds amid allegations that the district attorney there, Fani Willis, had an inappropriate relationship with a prosecutor on the case. Willis this week   a personal relationship but argued it should not disqualify her from the case or affect the prosecution."

Now,  , bitcoin and crypto traders are nervously eyeing outflows from Grayscale's bitcoin trust (GBTC), freshly converted into a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF—with JPMorgan warning $1.5 billion could still be yanked from the fund in coming weeks. — The bitcoin price has swung wildly since the approval of a raft of spot bitcoin ETFs, crashing back  \"Bitcoin looks mad heavy,\" Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto derivatives pioneer Bitmex who is now the chief investment officer of a fund called Maelstrom,   to X. \"I think we break $40,000 [per bitcoin], Hayes predicted, adding he sees the bitcoin price continuing to fall through until January 31 when there's a U.S. Treasury quarterly funding announcement. The bitcoin price—along with the price of ethereum, XRP and solana—have come under pressure in part due to fears outflows from Grayscale's flagship GBTC could accelerate. \"If the previous $3 billion estimate proves correct and given $1.5 billion has exited already, then there could be an additional $1.5 billion still to exit the bitcoin space via profit-taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note   by  . The value of Grayscale's GBTC has rocketed along with rising expectations it would be granted full spot bitcoin ETF status by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in recent months. Those that have bought into GBTC over that last few years are now \"taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" JPMorgan analysts said. \"Liquidity and market depth also matter, but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity,\" the analysts wrote, finding GBTC could see a further $5 billion to $10 billion of outflows if it loses its liquidity advantage. A fee war has broken out among spot bitcoin ETF issuers, with the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity offering rock-bottom fees for those who want to buy shares, driving demand for alternatives to Grayscale's GBTC. \"At the time of conversion, GBTC held approximately 620,000 bitcoin, which has now reduced to roughly 552,000 bitcoin,\" Matteo Greco, research analyst at investment company Fineqia International, said in emailed comments. \"The strong outflow can be attributed mainly to two factors: firstly, GBTC customers were restricted from redeeming shares and could only sell them on the secondary market due to the product's structure, before the conversion. This compelled many customers to hold their positions for years without an exit option unless they were willing to sell at a significant discount in the secondary market. Secondly, the higher management fee set by Grayscale (1.5%) compared to most competitors (0.2%/0.3%) led some investors to withdraw their investment from Grayscale, either to cash in profits or reinvest in more cost-effective ETFs.\" The bitcoin price has swung wildly in recent months as spot bitcoin ETF hype pushes up bitcoin,  However, despite the wild swings hitting the bitcoin price and the weighing on the price of other major cryptocurrencies ethereum, XRP and solana, many working in the crypto space remain upbeat. \"While the short-term impact [of the spot bitcoin ETF approval] is unclear and may cause volatility over the medium term, my personal view is that the increased access for retail investors, and alignment from institutions to adopt and promote a new asset class, is certainly positive,\" Jason Lau, chief innovation officer at the OKX exchange, said in emailed comments. \"I believe that the widespread acceptance of bitcoin will ultimately drive more users to interact with bitcoin itself and benefit from the power of a decentralized, permission-less network.\""

    "content": "Suicide Squad On Tuesday, Rocksteady   its first major game since 2015’s Arkham Knight, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. But if you’re wondering where press and creator reviews of the game are just a few days ahead of that, you’re not alone. This is not a situation where everyone has played and is just waiting for a day-before embargo, which is not   unusual. But instead, seemingly no one has actual copies of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League right now. I’ve been waiting for updates from the comms team for about two weeks now, and was supposed to hear something official yesterday, but didn’t. But asking around, the explanation is supposedly that since this is an always-online co-op game, the servers simply aren’t going to be turned on until the actual release on Tuesday the 30th. So no servers means that press can’t review the game ahead of that point. It’s…an explanation, I suppose. But again, for Rocksteady’s first enormous game in nine years, a hugely important title, it’s pretty strange, and it feels like something could have been concocted in, I don’t know, the last year, to still allow actual early playthroughs of the game for review. Even if this   a live game with a lot more content to come, starting a month after launch, there’s a sizable campaign to start with which obviously can be reviewed. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League It's also that this just wasn’t communicated at all. If the decision was made to not give out early copies because the servers wouldn’t be up, it seems strange that people were not told that ahead of time, and could plan accordingly. Now, it’s just too late anyway. I could get a code this morning and I simply don’t have the time to blaze through a massive game in two days for some sort of Monday embargo, and again, it doesn’t look like press can even play until launch anyway. I’m probably just going to end up buying the early edition myself at this rate. There is also the not-wholly-unthinkable possibility that codes are just not going out because WB is worried about reception to the game. This would be after a technically marred   where a lot of major outlets got their hands on the game for at least a couple hours, but the results were mixed-to-bad, overall. This led to an emergency release of the Alpha NDA where player feedback was more positive. But the idea may be if press didn’t like the preview, WB would rather do a day one launch with no reviews than potentially low ones. Can’t prove that, but given what happened with the preview, who knows. Even if it’s the server thing, this has not been handled well. It is extremely unusual to go into an “early access” launch that costs $100 with zero reviews of the game out. It is even weirder this is happening with Rocksteady, a beloved studio, and their first massive new game in nine years. So for me, my coverage will probably just be running commentary as I play the game starting Tuesday. And this will end what I would say is one of the worst pre-launch marketing campaigns I have ever seen for a major video game, regardless of its eventual quality.     ."

Iran, which has   involvement in the Jordan attack, also condemned the U.S. strikes, with foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani   claiming the attack was a “strategic mistake” by the U.S. that could result in “escalation and instability in the region.” Friday’s strikes came after Biden   with the families of those killed in Jordan for a dignified transfer.

It was not immediately clear whether CBS News had a specific correspondent in mind for the interview. Biden has granted interviews to a few CBS correspondents since during his presidency, including “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley, reporter Robert Costa and reporter Ed O’Keefe. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes. “We hope viewers enjoy watching what they tuned in for—the game,” White House spokesperson Ben LaBolt told Variety.

    "content": "FBI officials who searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago estate in 2022 did not search a locked closet and “hidden room” for White House documents, ABC News   Thursday, raising questions about whether Trump concealed more classified documents from the federal government. A security guard stands outside former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home on April 3, 2023, in  Federal officials   Mar-A-Lago in Aug. 2022 for White House documents Trump retained after leaving office, which resulted in them finding more than 11,000  —including more than 100 classified ones—and Trump eventually getting   for willfully retaining national defense information and obstruction, among other charges. Citing anonymous sources, ABC News   FBI officials did not search a locked closet—which investigators learned after the search that Trump had changed the lock on months earlier—while his attorney searched the property for classified materials to turn over the government in response to a subpoena. Investigators found the locked closet, but were reportedly told that the space behind the door “went nowhere” and so decided not to try and open it, according to ABC. Officials also were not aware at the time of a “hidden room” in Trump’s bedroom, and thus did not search it, ABC reports. Prosecutors questioned witnesses about the missed spaces during their investigation, with ABC reporting they focused on the rooms particularly in the three months before Trump was indicted. When asked about the rooms, the Trump campaign told ABC the investigations against the ex-president are “just desperate attempts at election interference ... to stop the presumptive Republican nominee for President.” It’s still unclear if Trump was storing any additional White House documents in his closet or hidden room, and if there are still any government materials at Mar-A-Lago or other Trump properties that haven’t been seized by the Biden administration. The Justice Department has not conducted any additional searches of Mar-A-Lago since its search in Aug. 2022, and it’s unclear if it has or at any point had any plans to do so. Former federal prosecutor Jordan Strauss told ABC the fact the FBI didn’t search the closet and hidden room was “a bit astonishing,” adding, “You're searching a former president's house. You [should] get it right the first time.” Trump has been indicted in Florida on 40 federal felony charges for retaining White House documents, and for allegedly obstructing the government’s efforts to get the documents back. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, which could result in a   of up to 450 years, if Trump were convicted on every single count and given the maximum sentence, as well as up to   in fines. The case is currently scheduled to go to trial in May, though it’s widely expected the date will get pushed back. Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who’s overseeing the case, will review Trump’s request to push back the trial date at a hearing in March, and the judge has already   several deadlines, which likely makes it harder for the trial to proceed on time. Trump was indicted in Florida in June 2023 following a lengthy investigation by federal prosecutors to try and recover the White House documents Trump brought back with him to Mar-A-Lago. While Trump voluntarily turned over 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives in Jan. 2022, the government then subpoenaed him for all remaining classified materials in May, to which Trump’s attorneys only turned over 38 documents. After receiving information suggesting there were still classified documents at Mar-A-Lago, the FBI searched the estate in August. Prosecutors have accused Trump of obstructing their investigation by allegedly purposely concealing documents from his attorney and investigators and not fully complying with the subpoena, including by asking his aide to move documents so they wouldn’t be found and attempting to delete security footage. The   against Trump alleges classified materials were also being stored throughout Mar-A-Lago where guests could find them, including in the estate’s ballroom and a bathroom.  (ABC News)  (Forbes)"

Two weeks after its January 18 release,  , currently with 1.3 million concurrent players, beating out CS2, Dota 2, PUBG Battlegrounds and Apex Legends, games which rarely, if ever, cede their top spots to anything else. And especially not for this long. It’s true that Palworld may have peaked a week or so ago, hitting Steam’s #2 all time high water mark with 2.1 million concurrent players, but it’s still putting up stunning numbers. And as of a few days ago, it was also the #1 most played game on Xbox Game Pass, a place where about a third of its playerbase resides. Pocketpair recently announced the game had 19 million players in just two weeks, 7 million of which are from Game Pass, and Microsoft has announced they will bring extra support to the game to help the small team manage things like updates and fixes and optimizations. They lucked out with this Game Pass pick, and they’re not going to let it go to waste. Palworld Why is Palworld still   widely played two weeks later, putting up Steam-best concurrents? Two main reasons: 1. As a multiplayer survival game with all sorts of customization options, it channels a bunch of previously popular games in the genre that you can play alongside friends, and when you add in Pokémon to the equation, it’s more appealing than many of them. 2. This game is a lot bigger than people realize. The map is huge, taking dozens of hours to fully explore. Base customization and building is close to infinite. And for the Pals themselves, you can have long term projects of not just catching all of them, and breeding and upgrading multiple Pals to get rare, powerful ones. Again, a process that takes a whole lot of investment, and a maxed out roster would be close to infinite playtime, with the way the game currently works. It's just such a cohesive whole, blending in mechanics from Fortnite, Pokémon and Tears of the Kingdom together in a way that shouldn’t work, but fit together seamlessly. Now that accusations of AI use and legal questions of the game “ripping off” Pokémon don’t seem to be going anywhere, it is free to exist and expand however it can. No, I don’t know how long the ride will last, given that interest may fade and I’m not sure if Pocketpair can deliver new content fast enough to hold the attention of lapsed players. But again, if you want to keep playing Palworld, the game is really good at giving you an extremely long list of things you can do. It has an endgame, as it were, and that has kept loads of players happy so far, it seems.     ."

Today’s    hints and answers are coming right up. In  , you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s   answers.  Just after the hints for each of today’s  groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.

A breezy perfect game brings me to three straight overall wins. Having FIRM and COMPANY next to each other in the starting grid was a dead giveaway for the yellows. The combo of STABLE and STY was then the entry point into the greens. I suspected there was a group of typical dog names, but I couldn’t figure out the fourth one — I’d argue FLUFFY is a more common name for a rabbit. In any case, I guessed that for the fourth word and lucked out. That left me with the purples which was a good thing, since I wouldn’t have figured out that connection. A pretty tricky purple group today. That’s all there is to it for today’s  clues and answers. Be sure to check   for hints and the solution for Sunday’s game if you need them."

He, and other critics, have pointed out that the fakeness of it all would have worked if only the scenes from the book-within-the-movie were greenscreen/CGI, but since that’s the look for the entire movie it doesn’t work. Quoth Bunch: Kurt Loder,  , sums it up nicely: “The awfulness of \"Argylle\" is so nearly complete that one regrets even having to mention the movie's release.” Ouch. He praises—and sympathizes with—the actors. As with every other critic, Loder wonders why on earth they gave Cavill that haircut. Not everyone hated it, of course, though the critics that didn’t pan the movie gave it middling praise. Keith Garlington c . He writes: As always, make up your own minds but buyer beware.

    "content": "The Last of Us Part 2 Naughty Dog just released a   about the making of The Last of Us Part 2, a fascinating look at the controversial, widely awarded video game. And of course, somewhere in those two hours some news was made. Neil Druckmann says that he’s figured out a concept for The Last of Us Part 3 because there “probably is one more chapter to this story.” My theory used to be that The Last of Us Part 3 would be timed so it would release and given the HBO show more content to work with after Part 2 was split into seasons 2 and 3 of that show, which we already know is happening. That could have been maybe four years from now, but the timeline doesn’t add up for that based on Druckmann’s comments. Naughty Dog’s next game will not be The Last of Us Part 3, it’s something else, likely a supposed sci-fi IP they’re working on for Sony, which no, is not a live service. After The Last of Us Factions fell apart, Naughty Dog outright declared they’d remain a single player studio, so here we are. But Druckmann’s comments indicate that The Last of Us Part 3 is likely miles and miles away. I’m talking like, the next decade, as given both development time and a wholly new game coming out before it, that’s probably at least 2030, given that we are just in the “I came up with an idea for it” stage. The Last of Us Part 2 There are no hints given about the story content of the game. It’s safe to assume Ellie would return, though I doubt most people predicted a second Last of Us game would largely be without Joel, so who knows. A larger question would be if Abby would return after the events of the second game, or if her part in the story is over. The Last of Us just finished casting Abby for season 2 of the show, who will be played by Kaitlyn Dever, who also read for Ellie when the show was first being conceived. But because of the strikes, The Last of Us season 2 will not arrive until 2025. But yeah, on the generous side, I don’t think The Last of Us Part 3 will get here any sooner than five years from now. There were seven years between The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, with Uncharted 4 in the middle. Seven years after TLOU would be 2027, but again, just being in the “concept” stage does not really set the stage for release three years from now. So we’ll be waiting a long while for this one and you will probably be playing it on your PS6.     ."

    "title": "‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’ Review: Darkest Day, Darkest Knight",
    "content": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League How do you sell a game no one wanted you to make? That seems to be a question Rocksteady has not figured out how to answer in the nine years since the release of their last acclaimed Arkham installment, the series being a high water mark for superhero video games. Everyone was excited to see what they’d make next, but the announcement of   created little but confusion. Why pick them? Because they use guns. Why do they need guns? Because they need loot. Why do they need loot? Because the game is...a live service looter shooter. And that’s when fans’ brains began to break. The Arkham trilogy is a masterclass in single player, story-driven superheroing. But with the announcement of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Rocksteady felt like they were chasing after Destiny, and to a lesser, and less-successful extent, Anthem, Avengers, Outriders and the other PvE co-op looters that never caught fire or just plain died. After 30+ hours into Suicide Squad with three of four characters maxed, I can say the end result is throwing cake and soup in a blender. Each good on their own, pretty unpalatable when combined. There are glimpses of Rocksteady’s old Arkham brilliance in here, and there are even some shining examples of what you   do in a live service looter. But the entire thing does not work as a cohesive whole, and the promise of “wait it will get better in the next year or two” is a song that players no longer want to dance to. The campaign is not good. And gets increasingly worse as time goes on. While the cutscenes are incredible, the facial capture tech might be industry-best and there are some genuinely funny lines and physical comedy moments, it’s just…a very bad story. There are no real twists and turns here. No character growth or development other than the stupidly expected “these misfits eventually like each other somewhat.” And while some have mocked those that have balked that you kill the Justice League in “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” it does not in fact feel good either thematically or mechanically. Mechanically, because nearly all of its boss fights are poorly designed. Thematically, because well, it is kind of awful going around shooting JLA members in the head as they lay brainwashed and dying. While I don’t believe the entire Arkhamverse JLA will  dead due to some future comic book voodoo, this feels like an idea that sounded better on paper but is weird and uncomfortable in practice from a narrative perspective. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League But the   aspect, by far, is how the game handles the ending (no specific spoilers here). It has to contort the storyline to such an absurd degree to set up the narrative for its live service that it destroy any sense of drama or a climax it  have had otherwise. The final boss of the game A) is at the end of a literal tutorial for the live endgame and B) directly lifts a boss fight from earlier in the game. It’s all so shameless, especially seeing what Rocksteady has been able to do with stories that have beginnings, middles and ends. You cannot script two thirds of a story and tell people to tune in once every three months to see what happens. It has to be able to stand on its own. This instead stands like a superhero with their legs broken by a baseball bat. But the combat, oh, the combat. It’s  fun. That’s one of the things. The combat in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League can be extremely enjoyable. The action-packed gameplay is actually very engaging in practice, even if the insane UI looks terrible in YouTube videos. Once you sort it all out, once you master traversal, once you throw builds together, it starts humming. The combination of flight, grenades, melee and gunplay probably one-ups all the entire trio of Anthem, Avengers and Outriders fairly easily in terms of how it feels to kill things. A problem, however, is class diversity, which only gets a   better as time goes on. The game wanted to have loot, but everyone uses the same guns, albeit restricted to three different archetypes per class. 80% of the differences are based around traversal, which is…fine, and that does feel different in gameplay, but this is probably the most similar classes have felt in any shooter like this. They have different traversal, supers and either ranged or close melee. They all use the same guns, grenades, legendary affixes, gear sets and hell, even some of their skill tree perks are identical, even if sure, you can make a build like “Harley really likes grenades.” This is one aspect Avengers did better, creating   distinctive kits based on the hero’s powers, at least at launch. In Suicide Squad, the gearing and gameplay may be better, but diversity in playstyle is not. Diversity is also the key as to why even with shooting and flying being a lot of fun, the places where you   that shooting and flying get impossibly dull. It is shocking how much the same type of encounters are reused, almost all of which have you bouncing around 3-5 rooftops, clearing enemies in some fashion, and repeating for 2-3 rounds. These are the side missions, they are the non-boss fight campaign missions, they are the   missions, except set inside an alternate universe with…sand. While looters are often being accused of being repetitive, this is like if literally the only thing to do in Destiny 2 was public events. It’s repetitive on a level I have rarely seen in this admittedly repetitive genre, and I was genuinely stunned when I got to the endgame and it was more of the same. Suicide Squad The   exception is a pretty cool time trial horde mode, something that all looters should launch with and few ever do. You kill guys to rack up time as difficulty ramps up, and you can leave and escape with loot or go until you die. It’s good! But it’s one thing, and not enough. But  good is the next boss fight I uncovered which, you guessed it, is the same as the “tutorial” boss fight from 20 hours earlier, except with more health and modifier annoyances. The boss fights in Suicide Squad are  . Three in the campaign and then the one in the endgame are designed against fast-moving opponents you are supposed to counter-shoot, then plink them down before they move again a half second later. It takes everything good about the game’s combat and throws it out the window. You literally can’t use grenades, melee, ultimates, finishers, anything in these fights. And you probably shouldn’t use anything but an AR or Sniper Rifle to boot, so good luck, short range characters and builds. The one that isn’t like that is an all-time terrible Batman boss fight that really has to be seen to be believed. The only sort of okay fight in the entire game is against Green Lantern, and even that still has the “he’s really far away and you can’t use any of your skills” problem. The endgame, where the “real” game is always supposed to begin, is a frustrating mix of concepts. There are some genuinely cool things the game does with endgame gearing and character progression. It has systems looters should have from day one, but many have to patch in months or years later, if ever. Suicide Squad has loadouts, it has total weapon customization, enhancements and re-rolls. It has set items and unique items and set items that also work with specific unique items for compounding bonuses. It has infinitely escalating difficulty and a paragon point system for bonus stats across your squad. But the problem is, and remains, the activities. I’m only four days into the game now and I don’t know if I can run another Elseworld roof-hopper or Brainiac boss fight. The entire substance of the game boils down to the same 4-5 activities and a number of very bad boss fights, so all that fun combat, all that cool gear loses its luster relatively quickly. As a DC fan, I can appreciate the gorgeous renderings of these characters and some legitimately funny moments with members of the squad. As a DC fan, I hate the structure and concept of this story and the ending is legitimately insulting. As a looter shooter fan, I can appreciate all the things the game gets right from day one, and how snappy combat feels from a team that has never done anything like this. As a looter shooter fan, I am already bored of the endgame which is just a reshuffling of everything else that came before it in deeply uninteresting ways. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League I am concerned about Rocksteady after this, where they have committed seven years and now more to follow building and supporting this as a live service. But they created an answer to a problem that didn’t exist. People wanted more superhero games from Rocksteady in the style of Arkham.  is the polar opposite of Arkham in almost every way, and even if it’s still a talented studio making it, it’s not what almost anyone wanted. I believe people can have a fun enough time with combat through the short campaign and early endgame, but it will be a miracle if this does any better than its Marvel predecessor in the long run, another case of “why did they make this a live looter shooter” that never produced a coherent case for itself. I will play along. I will grind some levels, farm some gear. I will return in a month when parallel universe Joker shows up in season 1 to see how this all goes. But despite some clear bright spots, Suicide Squad does not justify its own existence and feels like a colossal waste of time, money and energy when any other normal, standalone superhero game from Rocksteady probably would have blown away Arkham sales records. Everyone wants live service games to print money, but when the genre makes your game unattractive at baseline, and no one sticks around, yeah, maybe you should have made that other game instead.     ."

This prefix is used in various scientific and general contexts to indicate a factor of one millionth (in measurements) or to signify something that is significantly smaller than the norm or standard size, such as \"microorganism\" (a very small organism), \"microscope\" (an instrument for viewing very small objects), and \"microchip\" (a small semiconductor used to perform logic and memory functions)."

Lewis Hamilton is set to join Charles Leclerc and team principal Fred Vasseur at Ferrari in 2025.  The Mercedes team confirmed Hamilton’s departure after the 2024 season in a   Thursday, adding the star driver activated a release option in his contract. Scuderia Ferrari followed up Mercedes’ statement in   saying Hamilton will join them in 2025 on a multi-year contract. Hamilton will team up with Monégasque driver Charles Leclerc, who recently signed an   with the Italy-based team. The move leaves Ferrari’s second driver, Carlos Sainz Jr., without a seat for 2025 as his deal with Ferrari is set to expire at the end of the 2024 season. With a seat opening up at Mercedes, the move is also likely to trigger changes to other teams’ lineups. With Hamilton’s seven drivers’ world championships and Ferrari’s record 16 constructor titles, this is set to be the most decorated team-up in F1’s history. After dominating the F1 grid from 2013 to 2020, the Hamilton-Mercedes pairing has failed to win a race since December 2021 after Red Bull’s Max Verstappen’s controversial last-lap World Championship win that year. Since then, Red Bull and the Dutch driver have been utterly dominant, while Mercedes’ car has failed to adjust to the new design regulations that went into effect in the 2022 season. Despite being the most successful team in F1 history, Ferrari has also had to deal with its own struggles over the past few years and hasn’t won a constructor or driver’s championship since 2008. With Hamilton turning 40 at the start of the 2025 season, the Ferrari seat will likely be his last chance to overtake Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher’s tally of seven world titles. However, it remains to be seen how Ferrari will deal with having Leclerc, their current top driver, and Hamilton on the same team. Despite being pushed by his younger teammate George Russell, Hamilton has remained the de facto lead driver at Mercedes. 103. That is the total number of Formula 1 Grands Prix won by Hamilton, the most by any driver in the sport’s history. Michael Schumacher is in second place with 91 wins.  (BBC)  (Sky Sports)"

    "title": "Live Service Delirium Is Something Publishers Need To Self-Reflect On, Quickly",
    "content": "Hogwarts Legacy There’s a new report of   being circulated that 500 studios, or 95% of those surveyed, are working on live service games in some form. That “form” may be loose, as it considered “live” games anything with frequent, ongoing updates, but even if those numbers are skewed, yes, it’s clearly a trend as stated by those running the likes of Sony, Warner Bros and countless other studios. The idea, in theory, is that one-off single player games might be able to sell well, but they have no ongoing revenue after the fact, and with big budgets, may barely break even or still even lose money. But it’s becoming clear that there may be no faster way to lose money than to go all-in on live service, as depending on the genre, even the “successful” ones are burning through cash and players at this point. I bring this up, of course, mainly because of the launch of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a game that appears to be selling relatively poorly, judging by the truly abysmal 12,000 launch day playercount on Steam, albeit we’ll need more data to be sure. There, it’s easy to see how the idea that the game was live service in the first place was a hard sell, much more so than another standard, standalone superhero game from the Arkham creators would have been. Meanwhile, also within WB, we just had the release of Hogwarts Legacy, which was the first non-Rockstar game to outsell Call of Duty in a given year in a decade, and now it has 25 million in sales. And yet, when pressed about its future video game plans, WB CEO David Zaslav can only talk about live games, recurrent revenue and ongoing engagement. But at a certain point, in an effort to print money for long periods of time, you are going to end up lighting it on fire. Suicide Squad Suicide Squad is the best example of this. A Rocksteady Superman game, were one to exist, probably could have easily sold 15 million copies. Here, you have to convince people to pay $70 for a Suicide Squad game, a concept you cooked up so it could function as a looter shooter in the first place, then create a story that has no real ending, and must feed into live content. Then, as you’re making the game, and for an indefinite period of time after, you have to make   content, new characters, missions, loot, etc. And in this case, you’re not even selling that content, you’re selling cosmetics in the shop and cosmetic battle passes each season. It's a recipe for making both A) a game nobody asked for in the first place and B) something that is massively expensive to both produce and attempt to sustain. And if it fails to launch well (which seems to be the case with Suicide Squad) you have already committed to at least an extra year of content for something that is almost certainly not salvageable as a live game. This live service delirium is making some studios act wildly out of character. Sony pushed its studios so hard toward live service it blew up spectacularly, with Naughty Dog’s TLOU Factions being cancelled, years of work and millions of dollars wasted, and caused them to literally put out a statement saying they would remain a single player studio, as if live service was some sort of disease they’d just expelled from their body. It’s wild to me that a place like WB looks at a game like Hogwarts Legacy, one of the most successful non-sequel game launches of all time as a single-player, microtransaction-free experience and goes “but yes we should make more games in the Suicide Squad model.” Then you can shift your gaze a few degrees to look at the most explosively popular game of this year, Palworld, a game that yes, is “live” with online multiplayer and future updates, but there are no seasons, no microtransactions, you can easily play solo and have a great time. And it has gotten 19 million players in two weeks with a budget 2% the size of AAA blockbusters. It feels to me like the answer to expensive single player games is not to chase after live service, but to figure out how to…make them less expensive, but still fun enough to sell. Throwing your lot in with live service is like playing Squid Game with the rest of the industry. You may have 500 attempts but because of the “you must commit to and keep paying for this for months or years” concept, only a scarce few will succeed and almost all will crash and burn. It is much, much easier for players to commit to a single player game you play over a few weeks or a month and then move on. And even those, when longer and requiring more playtime, are   potentially massive hits, like Baldur’s Gate 3, easy GOTY winner and a largely single player game still putting up hundreds of thousands of players daily on Steam when it was released in August. Making any video game is hard. Making a live service game is becoming more like a death sentence in terms of investment. This  a dollars and cents thing. Companies have seen a few select live games do very well and think all their IP can now be turned into that. But they can’t. The industry won’t sustain it, the players won’t tolerate it. I would say this bubble is bursting, but that already happened. The corpses of Anthem, Avengers, Godfall, Outriders, Redfall weren’t enough to say that Suicide Squad would fail? We’ve been doing this for years and almost no one is making lightning strike here. Make good games. You cannot force players to like something or force an unrelated genre to fit into being a live service. It won’t work. It hasn’t worked. How many smash hit standalone games do we need to see and how many dead live services must we amass before publishers get the message?     ."

Alalshikh discussed a few different scenarios for Francis Ngannou, Anthony Joshua, who are set to meet later this year in Riyadh, as well as confirming Dmitry Bivol-Artur Beterbiev as a main event of an upcoming Saudi event in June. Alalshikh also shot down a rumored request from Gervonta Davis, who reportedly asked for “2 Ferraris” to fight on an upcoming Riyadh card. During the interview, Alalshikh said, “we will give him [Davis] 2 gloves if he wants to play in Riyadh.” With each passing week, it’s becoming more apparent Alalshikh and Saudi Arabia now hold sway over a large portion of the decision making for major fights in boxing, and there are significant roots being laid in mixed martial arts.

Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap.

I didn’t think there’d be something quite as simple as a group of caffeinated drinks, and even then, MATE isn’t something I’m too familiar with. I thought there’d be a bunch of towel-related words with DIRTY, DRY, TWIST and TEA (as in teatowel), but no dice. I then took a stab at the yellows and was correct.

When  first aired, I wanted to watch one episode at a time alongside viewers despite having access to all six episodes ahead of time.

The show has an identity crisis, straddling the line between its origins as its own mystery and  . The mystery itself hardly feels like a mystery at all, with no sense of organic urgency or even a coherent investigation. Whatever plot is buried in the show’s admittedly fantastic setting is constantly bogged down in dreary, tedious exposition and repetitive dialogue. Characters constantly make bizarre decisions, and the sloppy script is in a constant hurry to spin its wheels. Every time something exciting or interesting happens, the show slams on its brakes, devolving into yet another tedious conversation or leaping to a new scene in the most jarring way possible. Occasionally, in various desperate acts of fan-service, a line from Season 1 is jammed in where it doesn’t belong. One Season 1 callback in particular during the season finale made me laugh out loud in dismay. I may or may not have shouted at my TV. Night Country None of the characters are particularly likable. That’s a big problem, though it could have been a tolerable one if the story they inhabited was compelling enough to make such crappy people watchable. Shows like  manage this delicate balancing act with style. Not so in  Jodie Foster’s Liz Danvers has barely a single redeeming quality and her partner, Detective Navarro (Kali Reis) is just as hard to stomach. You can get away with having a detective be this awful of a human being only if they make up for it with a Hercule Poirot-like intellect. Neither Danvers or Navarro possess much in the way of little grey cells, however. In the end, I felt nothing but disdain and disgust for both characters, whose actions in the season finale are beyond the pale. The creators of the show don’t seem to think so. They want us to connect with these detectives and the choices they make. Unfortunately, it’s never earned. Neither is the show’s utterly predictable, wholly unsatisfying ending—though if you like a good dose of cloying preachiness, this might be just the show for you. The ingredients of  make for a sad list: Predictable, boring, unpleasant, preachy, and derivative. Toss in a dash of bad CGI and some atrociously mediocre cinematography—not to mention all the lame needle drops—and you’re left with something that barely resembles   The final episode feels less like the franchise it ostensibly is a part of and more like a cheap knockoff of the film it cribs from so brazenly:  You’d be better off watching that gripping drama instead of this badly written snoozefest. (I’d urge rather strongly that you watch it first). I finished watching  on Amazon Prime Video earlier this week. The parallels between the two shows are astonishing. Both are loosely rooted in the Nordic noir tradition. Both take place in exotic small towns far from the big city: Ennis, Alaska and Deadloch, Tasmania. Both have a pair of female detectives investigating the murders of men, and both have overbearing male police bosses who threaten to interfere. Each mystery involves missing tongues, believe it or not. But  is a story with characters you care about, a crude but charming sense of humor, and a coherent mystery with actual suspects that keeps you guessing right up until the end.  can barely keep track of its messy, sprawling cast let alone whatever case it is the detectives are trying to solve. I predicted the ending (or at least  of the ending) in the season premiere. The only surprising thing about this show is how obvious it is. But please, by all means keep watching! I’ll be reviewing each episode as we go and I’d love to chat with you about it week to week. I suspect even the show’s staunchest defenders may be disappointed in the end; no matter what your theory may be—and there are many—I can’t see how this show’s conclusion pays off in any kind of satisfying way. Then again, maybe I’m just asking the wrong bleeping questions. Watch  : What are your thoughts on this show so far? Let me know on  and . Links to my episodic reviews:"

    "content": "Find the links between the words to win today's game of Connections. Hey there, everyone! Happy Friday. I hope you have a super relaxing end to the week as we ease into the weekend. Today’s    hints and answers are coming right up. In  , you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s   answers.  Just after the hints for each of today’s  groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them. Today’s 16 words are: And the clues for today’s groups are: Need some extra help? Be warned: we’re starting to get into  Today’s groups are... Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s   answers. This is your final warning! Today’s  answers are... No perfect game today, but back-to-back wins are always welcome. I found today’s game a little easier than it looked at first glance, and I think figuring out the groups in order of difficulty helped quite a bit. BREAK and RECESS gave me an entry point into the yellows. I was slightly stumped as to which word should go with BUCKLE, LOOP and STRAP. I made an incorrect guess (HOLEY) before remembering the mantra of “keep it simple” and correctly including HOLE. From there, I figured I should try to group together the homophones, and that worked. I didn’t deduce the purple connection before completing that group (I am unfamiliar with “dogwood”), but a win is a win. That’s all there is to it for today’s  clues and answers. Be sure to check   for hints and the solution for Saturday’s game if you need them. P.S. The mention of driftwood got this song from a band I loved as a kid stuck in my head. It’s terrific."

The little one has passed, leaving the world and icy reflective white. A bigger one is on the way, promising blizzards and drifts. For now, we enjoy the sun on our faces and the crisp, clear mountain air. Oh, and Wordle of course. We have one of those to solve today, I believe. Let’s dive right in! On the brink of a great discovery or triumph or somesuch. This Wordle has a double letter in it. . . . . Today's Wordle I thought of  because I’ve just written a review of  The show was criminally bad! What a disappointment! For me, however,  left just 58 possible solutions. I thought for sure  would clean up most of the rest but I was unlucky, with a whopping 9 still to choose from, many of which were quite similar. I used  because it fit so nicely with  and that did the trick, leaving me with just one word:  for the win! Huzzah! Total wash. 0 points for guessing in four and 0 for tying the Bot. C’est la vie! The word 'verge' has an interesting etymology that traces back to both Latin and Old French origins. The term comes from the Latin word  , which means 'rod', 'stick', or 'wand'. This Latin root reflects the original sense of the word as something related to a physical boundary or a marker. From Latin, the word evolved into the Old French word  , meaning 'rod' or 'staff', but also used to denote the 'penis' in a more vulgar sense. The Old French term retained the meaning of a rod or staff used as a symbol of authority or power, such as the ceremonial staff carried by certain officials. By the time it entered Middle English, 'verge' had acquired a variety of meanings, including a rod or staff, the edge or margin of something, and even a boundary or limit. Today, 'verge' is commonly used in English to refer to the edge or brink of something, such as being on the verge of an important discovery or event, reflecting its historical roots in notions of boundaries and limits. This layered etymology showcases how 'verge' has evolved over time, carrying with it notions of authority, boundaries, and transitions from its Latin origins through to modern English usage."

    "content": "Last Wish Destiny 2 has now begun a six week stretch where if you complete an exhaustive list of  , mostly Dreaming City-based activities, you can get one token, per week, per account, to unlock something special. This event is mostly for free-to-play players, or those who have missed the last year of content. You can pick from Last Wish raid weapons to craft (well, one of them), Lightfall exotics or cosmetics/materials. So, here’s what I think you should buy, and this has to be written from a F2P perspective as I just don’t know how beneficial it’s going to be to most players: – This is one of the most meta rocket launchers in the game right now, if not   most meta, thanks to new updated rolls. This is sort of up to the user, but best for overall damage is probably  . You can also use  for damage or  for even more rockets, four at a time.  – They call it “Fakebringer” but it’s arc and as such, has a pretty fun roll in the form of   now. If I had my pick, that’s what I’d go for.  – Another fun updated weapon because it’s a rare one that can roll with two Void 3.0 perks at once,  which work great in synergy with one another. Briarbinds  These are not the best exotics offered, but I would say they are the best exotics that don’t use Strand or Stasis, which are   free, you need to own either Lightfall or Beyond Light. These three, Void buddy boosts for Warlock, Arc moth buddies for Hunter and giant flame tornado buddy for Titan, are your best bet. – Materials are lame, don’t bother spending tokens on that as there are so many other better ways to get them. Meanwhile, the Festival of the Lost black leather ornament is one of the best shaders in the game, and was only available for a few weeks during the event this year. I didn’t think there’d be another way to get it until next year, but here we are. If you don’t care about the raid weapons or exotics, grab up a bunch of these. Destiny 2 Fundamentally I think this event is bad because it’s focused on free-to-play players but giving them often   grinds to get even a fraction of what paying players got a lot easier, but I guess it’s better than nothing. That’s my advice for token spending, feel free to disagree.     ."

    "title": "Xbox’s Megahit ‘Hi-Fi Rush’ Is Definitely Coming To PS5 And Switch",
    "content": "Hi-Fi Rush There were  that this was maybe going to happen, but Microsoft never actually announced that Hi-Fi Rush would expand beyond Xbox and Game Pass and head to rival systems like PS5 and Nintendo Switch. Well, now a new, confirmed datamine says that is all but certainly happening. There are three different upcoming shirts whose texture files have been found. One is blue and says “I’m here baby!” another is red and says “Rock out anywhere!” There’s also a green one for the OG Xbox. I’m not quite sure about the blue PS reference, or if it is one, but “rock out anywhere” is obviously tied to the Switch’s portability. Again, this has not been announced, but these files are real and I mean, come on. No more pretending this isn’t happening. As such, expect it to restart the great debate of whether or not Xbox should be bringing its exclusives to other platforms. Hi-Fi Rush was Xbox’s most-awarded/nominated game in 2023, a wildly successful shadow drop that seemed to indicate Microsoft had some surprise hits in them. But now the question is whether it “devalues” the game by bringing it to other platforms. It’s in line with Microsoft’s stayed “play Xbox games anywhere” idea, but it’s hard to see the opposite of this ever happening. Games like Horizon Zero Dawn or Mario Kart 8 could be “old enough,” but PlayStation or Nintendo would never give them out to their rivals regardless. The attached rumor to this makes slightly more sense, that Microsoft may plan to bring Sea of Thieves to PlayStation and/or Nintendo as well. While another exclusive game, it’s at least one that relies on online multiplayer, so expanding the playerbase would be a good thing. And that game   very old, so I don’t see this as much of a philosophical issue. After all, Sony-owned Bungie has Destiny 2 on all platforms (well, not Switch), and will release new MP game Marathon on multiple platforms as well. The question is where you draw the line. A thought experiment, if not a potential rumor, was that something like Halo Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer could expand to PlayStation. Again, you can use the “game is old, game is multiplayer” idea of Sea of Thieves to justify that, but do you   want to put Master Chief on PlayStation? Really? I guess that’s for Microsoft to decide. The only thing right now that appears to be definitely happening is this Hi-Fi Rush expansion. I expect it to be announced soon, and a debate that happened a few weeks ago will no doubt start percolating again.     ."

    "title": "10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Started ‘Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League’",
    "content": "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Today marks the official launch of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a massively important game for WB and Rocksteady, one that is attempting to merge DC storytelling with live service loot shooting. I’ll have more  on how that goes exactly in my full review, but this is not that. Rather, if you’re just starting today, I will put my 24 hours of Early Access playtime to use here to explain some things I think you should know. Here are ten things I wish I knew when I started Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League: – If you’re like me, you maybe wanted to start with the one Arkhamverse character you know, and the most famous of the bunch, Harley Quinn. However, Harley has the  learning curve when it comes to her bat-grapple-based traversal compared to all of the others, and you may find yourself frustrated with it early on. I think the main issue here is that most people are going to try to play it like Spider-Man, given that it has the swing and dive, swing and dive mechanic. However, it doesn’t work as well as Spider-Man and you will hit the ground a lot if you’re only trying this. Rather, a key part of this is not forgetting the Arkham roots here with Batman’s grapple point stuff. So, you will often do one big swing, but instead of going for another if you’re too low, you grapple point, hit A before reaching the point to do a little flip, and that refreshes your swing. Trying to purely swing over and over without refreshing via the grapple point mechanic will not go well, and the grapple point has a   long range, so it will get you out of a lot of “I’m about to crash” situations. – I won’t have one of these for each character because I think King Shark and Boomerang are relatively straightforward, but Deadshot’s jetpack should have a little note here. You want to use his big boost at the beginning of accelerating , not the end, or else you will barely be able to use it all. And when the game says you can “kickstart” what it does   tell you is that you do not want to wait all the way until the bar is depleted, or else you only get about three quarters of your fuel back. Rather, you want to wait until  before the end, as if you kickstart then you will get your entire fuel store back. Also, there is an early skill upgrade to make his jet fuel last longer overall. Suicide Squad  – This one took me a while to learn. In a lot of the objective-based missions, when you are told to blow up crystals on roofs or rescue civilians on roofs you really do not need to be killing all enemies in the arena to do this, as many will just never stop coming anyway. For objectives like that you can just clear out a local group, break the crystal or grab the person and move on. Speed is key. For other more kill-based objectives, the game throws what I will call “distraction” enemies at you, usually brutes, snipers or helicopters. I think it’s rarely useful to bother counter-sniping and jetting off to kill far-away snipers, easily the most irritating enemies in the game. Brutes and helicopters are sometimes worth killing, but when speed is of the essence, sometimes you want to be killing the little guys instead. In the Ivy missions, for instance, you only need to kill grunts to progress when the game will be throwing random brutes at you that you should mostly just be avoiding.  – I was sort of confused about loot in the game, as you start getting legendary gear as soon as the first few missions, gear you many not see outclassed for practically the whole campaign. That’s because loot…really isn’t all that important for the story mode of this game. It’s more of an introduction to the concept, and things come together more in the endgame as you unlock more sets, more Notorious weapons and realize that you   start wanting to swap out gear more. But yes it may come across as a very strange system during the actual story campaign. – This is easy to miss and something a lot of looters have to patch in after the fact, but Suicide Squad is at least launching with it. You can save a loadout that includes both your gear and your cosmetic look, name it, and mark it for which character you’re using. There are a lot of slots and while it may not be worth doing early on, it will become kind of essential later if you want to do more than one build. Suicide Squad – I am using the Guardian Ranks moniker here as it’s like the original system from Borderlands, or Paragon Levels in Diablo 3. Max level for characters is 30, which will complete your skill board. Then, after that, each level unlocks a point in a Squad leveling system that gives you things like 0.5% crt chance at a time or shield capacity. This applies to all squad members and all post-30 squad levels will put points into this. – This is obviously going to be a pretty microtransaction-heavy game long term, at least on the cosmetic front, but there are a few solid looks you can earn from doing Riddler traversal challenges and getting at least 2/3 stars in them, which I would say is very, very easy. Making it even easier is using Deadshot most of the time who can precision fly through rings a lot better than other characters. Suicide Squad – You really do not need to do any of the side quests during story mode other than the essential ones they  you do. The entire point of these is to unlock vendors and vendor upgrades, which even on max difficulty, is something that I don’t think is terribly essential just for the normal campaign, as that only really comes into play in the endgame in any significant capacity. There’s no   in doing them early, it’s just not a necessity. One of the reasons those vendors and gear customization and “builds” don’t really matter is because how boss fights work in this game. Three major boss fights are all about the counter-shot ability, and because of how quickly the bosses move, you will almost never be close enough to them to use weapons like SMGs or shotguns effectively. Snipers or ARs or   heavies are your best bet. And things like grenades? Forget it. Another boss fight that is   just zipping around counter-shooting is instead just a giant bullet sponge but again, longer range weapons are still better here. These boss fights were not designed well for all characters or builds and you’ll have to adjust for that. – If you want the broad strokes of the endgame that kicks off after you kill the final boss, which introduces that endgame, it goes as follows: That’s the gist of it. You’re rinsing and repeating mainly the Elseworlds missions on higher and higher difficulties as you inch up your min-maxing on your build. We can discuss whether this is fun or not later, but that’s what it is. Those are ten things, maybe ten more later. Enjoy.     ."
